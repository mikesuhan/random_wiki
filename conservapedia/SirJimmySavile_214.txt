Sir Jimmy Savile  (31 October 1926 â€“ 29 October 2011) was a British  entertainer  and presenter. Savile (born 1926) began his career as an all-in wrestler before becoming a  disc jockey  in the clubs of the north of  England , in and around his home city of  Leeds . He was an early DJ on the  BBC 's  pop music   radio  station Radio 1 and was the first presenter on BBC Television's iconic and long running show  Top of The Pops . From the 1970s he hosted  Jim'll Fix It  where he granted requests to (mainly) children; the show was revived in 2007. He was also noted for his  charity  work: he ran numerous marathons, and also did unpaid work in hospital mortuaries.

Since his death he has been accused of being a serial sex offender against young girls appearing on his shows or who came into contact with him through his various "charitable" activities. Police investigations are continuing. (October 2012)
