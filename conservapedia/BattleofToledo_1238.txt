The  Battle of Toledo  was fought in A.D. 1085, as part of the  Reconquista .

King Alfonso VI of Castile (1040-1109) defeated the  Muslims  in Toledo, an important city beside the Tajo River. With this victory,  Christians  took control of a strategic area, from which they could start new military campaigns and thus begin converting the Iberian Peninsula ( Spain  and  Portugal ) back to  Christianity  after hundreds of years of Islamic rule. The conversion of the Roman population to Islam and the conversion of the Andalusian population to Christianity are both hotly contested topics in the fields of both Islamic history and Spanish history. The most popular view holds that the Romano-Spanish population retained much of their  Christian  faith during the Andalusian period of Spanish history with a large degree of accommodation reached with the local Islamic elites.
