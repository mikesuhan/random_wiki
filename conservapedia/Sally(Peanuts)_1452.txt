Sally Brown  is  Charlie Brown 's younger sister in the  Peanuts  comic strip.  Like most of the characters in the strip, she thinks he's a  blockhead  and gets easily upset at him without just cause.  She has a crush on  Linus , who does not feel the same way and finds her annoying.  Sally has a tendency to be whiny and difficult and often comes across as not very intelligent, which is what would be expected through the perspective of big brother Charlie Brown.
