A  semi-presidential  system is republican system of governance that combines elements of presidential  democracy  with parliamentary democracy. Typically, the head of state is the  president , directly elected by the people with a large degree of power over the government, whilst the head of government is the  prime minister  nominated by the president but who can be dismissed by the legislature. Typically, an agreement is reached over which of the two heads (state and government) will have the lead in policy areas. For example, in  France , a well known example of semi presidential democracy, the president leads foreign policy and the prime minister leads domestic policy.
