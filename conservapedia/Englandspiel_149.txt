Englandspiel  was the codename given to a highly successful  German  counter- espionage  operation in the  Netherlands  during  World War II . The occupying German fores obtained the codes used by the Dutch reistance in radio contact with  Britain , and by impersonating the resistance the Germans were able to capture 57 agents sent in from  England , and arrest hundreds of Dutch resistance personnel. The pinnacle of Englandspiel was the failure of Operation Market Garden, an Allied attempt to break through German lines at  Arnhem  in September 1944. [1]
