Corfu  is a  Greek   island  and town in the  Ionian Sea .

The Old Town of Corfu is located in a strategic position at the entrance of the  Adriatic Sea , and has its roots in the 8th century BC. The three forts of the town, designed by renowned  Venetian  engineers, were used for four centuries to defend the maritime trading interests of the Republic of  Venice  against the  Ottoman Empire . In the course of time, the forts were repaired and partly rebuilt several times, more recently under British rule in the 19th century. The mainly neoclassical housing stock of the Old Town is partly from the Venetian period, partly of later construction, notably the 19th century. As a fortified  Mediterranean  port, Corfuâ€™s urban and port ensemble is notable for its high level of integrity and authenticity.
