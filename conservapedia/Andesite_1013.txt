Andesite  is a gray to black volcanic rock which is the main component of many  volcanic  peaks. [1]

Andesite has between about 52 and 63 weight percent  silica  (SiO2). It contains  crystals  composed primarily of plagioclase  feldspar  and one or more of the minerals pyroxene (clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene) and lesser amounts of  hornblende . At the lower end of the silica range, andesite  lava  may also contain  olivine . Andesite  magma  commonly erupts from stratovolcanoes as thick lava flows, some reaching several kilometres in length. Andesite magma can also generate strong explosive eruptions to form pyroclastic flows and surges and enormous eruption columns. Andesites erupt at temperatures between 900 and 1100 °C.

Andesite was named after the  Andes  mountains, one of the places it is found. [1]
