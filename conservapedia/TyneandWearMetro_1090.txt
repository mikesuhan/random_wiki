The  Tyne & Wear Metro  is an urban light rail transit system linking the five districts of  Tyne and Wear , north-east  England . The system is operated by the municipally-controlled Tyne & Wear Passenger Transport Executive (Nexus), and first opened in 1980. The original system mainly used former  British Rail  lines but included new underground sections in the centres of  Newcastle upon Tyne  and  Gateshead . The first phase of the system was completed in 1984; it was subsequently extended in 1991 to Newcastle Airport and in 2002 to  Sunderland .
