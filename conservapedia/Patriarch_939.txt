The  Patriarch  is the highest-ranking  bishop  in a self-governing and historically significant  Christian  center. The most famous are the ancient patriarchates of Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem, which are  Eastern Orthodox  jurisdictions.

The head of the  Roman Catholic Church , the  Pope , is styled the "Patriarch of the West" while the leader of Eastern Orthodoxy, the Patriarch of Constantinople, is styled the "Ecumenical Patriarch." In more recent years, newer bishoprics have had the title of "patriarchate" given to them. Examples are the Orthodox churches in Russia (i.e. Moscow), Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria, and Georgia, plus the Roman Catholic Church's own patriarchate of Jerusalem.

The term is also used to refer to any supremely high-ranking  male  figure in a  family  or social group.

In  Christianity , the  patriarchs  are also a group of  Jews  from the  Old Testament  who ruled in the Second Millennium, between the  Flood  and the reign of  King David :

These men had many sons and ruled over large families. Analogously, one might today use the term "patriarch" to refer to the male head of a large and influential family, such as  George H.W. Bush  or  Joseph Kennedy .
