Peter Anthony DeFazio  (born May 27, 1947 in Needham, Massachusetts) currently serves as the  Democratic  U.S. Representative from  Oregon 's 4th congressional district. Previously he served as a county commissioner in Lane County, Oregon.  He received his college education in  Massachusetts  and is a characteristic  Massachusetts liberal .

DeFazio has a reputation as one of the most  liberal  members of Congress.  He joined, for example, with other  House  liberals in demanding that  Obama  fire his Treasury Secretary because he was not liberal enough. [1]   DeFazio even votes against liberal legislation because it was not liberal enough, as when he announced he was switching his "yes" vote to "no" on  ObamaCare  because it did not spend enough money for his liking.

In October 2010, facing the strongest challenge to his reelection in his career, DeFazio announced that he would be investigating how to impeach "Justice Roberts" of the U.S. Supreme Court, apparently not realizing that he is the  Chief  Justice.
