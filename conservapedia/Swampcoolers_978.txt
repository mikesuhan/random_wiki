Evaporative cooling techniques are most commonly found in warm, dry climates such as in the Southwest where the  humidity  is low, although they are found throughout the country. They usually work by spraying cool water into straw, cooling the air as the spray evaporates.  They are much cheaper than refrigeration units.
