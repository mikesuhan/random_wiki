A  homophone  is one of two or more words or  phrases  that are pronounced the same way, but differ in spelling, meaning, or both. [1]  An example of homophones would be the words "tide" and "tied". The word is derived from the Greek, meaning "same sound". The word was first used in English in 1843. [2]   Homophones that are also spelled the same way are called  homonyms .
