Jerusalem  (words  William Blake  1804, music  Hubert Parry  1916), is a hymn and patriotic song that is amongst the top contenders for the title of "England's unofficial national anthem."  [1]  Blake's original poem was set to music by Parry during the First World War. The poem/hymn speaks of a perfect England of the imagination, but one that could exist in reality if only we all worked together. Many of Blake's references are obscure, and almost certainly reflect his mystical philosophy. Scholars have been arguing over their meaning for 200 years.

Jerusalem is also unusual as a patriotic song in that it is named after a foreign city. It is the official anthem of both the  British National Party   and  the  Labour Party , the conservative  Women's Institute  and the socialist  Trades Union  movement. [2] [3]  Since it appeals to those on both the left and the right, it is often regarded as ideally suited as a national anthem. Officially, however, England has no  national anthem .

In the 1980s, the British TV satirical puppet show,  Spitting Image , featured a spoof version of this song which ended with the lines:

Satirical group Monty Python also referred to the hymn several times, including Eric Idle singing portions of the song in between introducing acts from the "Cardiff Room, Libya".
