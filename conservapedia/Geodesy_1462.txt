Geodesy  is the ancient  science  of measuring the Earth. It is now considered to be a subdiscipline of  cartography . One of the primary concerns of geodeticists is the  coordinatization  of the Earth. Geodesy has also studied the physical form of the earth, with a large number of societies in antiquity speculating over its form and physical shape.
