Currently, the private marketing system, assisted by computerization of records, generally can trace products back to their original suppliers, although not necessarily all the way to the farm. It has been suggested that a type of traceback program might be formalized to monitor and contain outbreaks of foodborne illness better.  USDA  has called “animal identification” an important element of any traceback system. Many livestock producers currently identify their animals using backtags, ear tags, tattoos, and other devices, so incorporating animal identification into a traceback program might not be difficult.
