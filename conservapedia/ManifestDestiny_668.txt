Manifest Destiny  was the belief promoted by  Democratic  politicians such as  James K. Polk  that it was inevitable that the American people would create a nation from the  Atlantic Ocean  to the  Pacific Ocean . The goal was to promote  Jacksonian Democracy  by expanding the lands available to yeomen farmers and slave plantation owners.  Conservatives at the time, led by the  Whig Party , strongly rejected the doctrine and instead said that America's future was in modernization, urbanization and industrialization.   Henry Clay  and  Abraham Lincoln  were leading Whigs who spoke out against manifest Destiny, especially when it entangled the U.S. in a war with Mexico in 1846.

The secret  Ostend Manifesto , written in 1854 by the U.S. ambassadors to Spain, France, and Britain was essentially a plan for the United States to purchase  Cuba  from Spain. [1]  Southern Democrats hoped the acquired island would become another slave state, and that future acquisitions would negate northerners' efforts to prevent the spread of slavery.

When the Ostend manifesto became public, antislavery northerners, denounced the agreement and the plan never went into effect. In 1844  James K. Polk , an expansionist Democrat defeated  Henry Clay , a Whig who rejected expansion. "Fifty-Four Forty or Fight!" became a catchphrase for the annexation of the entire Oregon Country, then co-owned with Britain. The slogan referred to the region's northern boundary of 54°40ʹ N latitude (that is, the southern boundary of Alaska). The U.S. and Britain reached a compromise, splitting the region in half along the 49th parallel, which forms to this day marks the US-Canada. Polk also added the new state of  Texas  to the Union, and after winning the  Mexican-American War , purchased New Mexico, Arizona and California as well.  Whigs vehemently opposed his war and his expansion plans.
