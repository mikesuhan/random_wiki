Dave Ramsey held real estate worth 4 million dollars by age twenty-six, only to lose it all by age thirty, admittedly, by his "own stupidity" and mismanagement of money. He used the experience of rebuilding his financial life as the foundation for his teachings, which are based on Biblical, common sense financial principles that most everyone knows, but hardly anyone uses.

This difficult learning experience was particularly hard on his wife, Sharon, with whom he credits with helping keep him together through the process. He and Sharon have three children, Denise, Rachel, and Daniel.

Dave has been a regular contributor to various cable TV outlets, including CNN, CNBC, and Fox News Channel. He currently hosts a live television version of  The Dave Ramsey Show  on Fox Business, which has the same call-in format as his radio show.
