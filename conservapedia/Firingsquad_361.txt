The  firing squad  is a type of  death penalty  that is used particularly in wartime. It also remains an option for the death row inmates convicted prior to March 15, 2004 in  Utah . [1]

The firing squad, as its name suggests, consists of a row of soldiers or officers who shoot simultaneously at a victim tied to a post.  In some implementations all but one of the rifles has actual ammunition, so that none of the shooters is sure that he actually killed the victim.  In some situations if the shooters fail to kill the victim; the victim may be pardoned from any further execution attempts.

It is customary in most cases to blindfold the person being shot, out of a common sense of decency, but he can decide not to be blindfolded.
