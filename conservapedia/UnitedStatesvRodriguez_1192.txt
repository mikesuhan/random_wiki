In  United States v. Rodriguez , 67 F.3d 1312 (7th Cir. 1995), the Court of Appeals for the  Seventh Circuit  affirmed the lower court's decision to sentence Rodriguez to life in prison for involvement in a conspiracy to deliver marijuana.

In response to Rodriguez's contention with respect to  venue , the Court declared, "Mr. Rodriguez's contention with respect to venue is untimely. A defendant  may waive the right to insist that the government establish venue.  United States v. McDonough   A defect not apparent on the face of the indictment may be raised in a motion for acquittal,  United States v. Brandon ,  United States v. John , but Mr. Rodriguez's  motion for acquittal did not raise the venue issue. Mr. Rodriguez did not request a jury instruction on venue or object to the failure to give one."
