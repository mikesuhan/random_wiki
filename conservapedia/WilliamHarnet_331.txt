William Michael Harnett  (1848 - 1892) was an Irish-born  American   painter .

Harnett’s paintings were extremely popular with the public, but most critics thought his works were mere trickery. Both groups ignored his outstanding skill in abstract composition. After a long period of disrepute, Harnett’s works again were appreciated and sought after in the mid-20th century. [1]

Harnet preferred, for his  still life  subjects, musical instruments, hunted animals and firearms.

Harnett’s expertise in  trompe d’oeil  inspired an entire  American school  of this style of  painting  in the later nineteenth century that continued into the nineteen twenties.  There were many skilled practitioners in this style, but most critics agree that William Harnett was unsurpassed in his elegance of design and skill of execution. [2]
