A  yak  is a hardy shaggy  bovine   ruminant  mammal commonly domesticated in  Tibet  and neighboring areas of central  Asia .

Yaks are extremely useful animals:

Domestic yaks commonly wear bells round their necks, to facilitate locating them, keeping herds together, and to distinguish them from wild yaks.

A hybrid between the yak and the domestic  cow , the dzho (or zo), is also common in the same regions.
