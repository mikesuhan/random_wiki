Walter Aston was born in  England  and may have been descended from the Astons of  Staffordshire , England. He settled at Shirley Hundred in the Colony of Virginia. Aston represented Shirley Hundred Island for the first time from 1629 to 1630. He continued to be a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses from 1631-1632, 1632-1633, 1641, 1642-1643.

Aston married twice, first to a woman whose maiden name was Warbowe then to Hannah Jordan who outlived him. She later married Col. Edward Hill.

By the time he died on April 3, 1656 he was a Lt. Col. and he is buried at the Westover Parish Church, Charles City Co., Virginia.

His son, Walter Aston, Jr., died January 29, 1666, and is buried near his father at Westover Parish Church.
