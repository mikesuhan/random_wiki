Atheists commonly assert that Bible believing Christians hate so called "modern science"/modern doctrines. Last time I checked Darwinism is over 150 years old and  Henry Morris 's  creation science  movement is around 50 years old.

By the way atheists, newer is not necessarily truer. Yet, many arrogant and illogical atheists continue to commit the  appeal to novelty  logical fallacy and disparage the Bible.

King Solomon  taught the value of hard work and thrift in ancient times and if more modern secular European leaders paid attention to the wisdom of Solomon their countries would not be mired in debt and in such dire straits!  Checkmate atheists! Once again, the Bible shows itself to be tried, true and triumphant!  One more, the "superior modern atheist intellect" is bested by God. Yet again, atheist pride cometh before their fall.

History lesson for "atheist intellectuals": While  King Solomon 's reign was marked with prosperity, the modern atheist regimes of  Mao Zedong  and  Joseph Stalin  were marked by atheist regime created famine. And of course, both these atheist leaders were huge fans of  evolutionary pseudoscience . [1]  Divine imparted wisdom triumps over "superior modern atheist intellects"!

"The fool in his heart says there is no God. They are corrupt, they do abominable deeds, there is none that does good. The LORD looks down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there are any that act wisely, that seek after God. They have all gone astray, they are all alike corrupt; there is none that does good, no, not one." - Psalm 14: 1-3
