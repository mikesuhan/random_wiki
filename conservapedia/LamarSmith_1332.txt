Lamar Seeligson Smith   (born November 19, 1947) is an increasingly  liberal   Republican  U.S. Representative from  Texas 's 21st Congressional District, who was elected to office in 1987. He is one of the wealthiest members of  Congress .

Lamar Smith pretends to be a fiscal conservative based on his vote for a balanced budget amendment, which is a meaningless vote because the amendment has no chance of passing in the  U.S. Senate .  Smith also voted for ending taxpayer support of presidential campaigns, which is likewise almost meaningless. He did vote against Obama's raising of the debt ceiling. [1]

He is responsible for introducing the controversial  SOPA  bill into the House of Representatives as an attempt to curb online piracy and copyright infringement.

Rep Smith has introduced, and voted for, a number of bills which placed restrictions on abortion, and has a 100% rating from the  National Right to Life Committee .

In June 2011, Smith became embroiled in a controversy over his opposition to the  Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act of 2011 , which would have ended the prohibition of marijuana at the federal level. The bill was introduced by  Barney Frank . Smith announced that he had no intention of giving the bill a hearing in the  House Judiciary Committee , of which he is the chairman, thus causing the bill to never reach the floor.

Richard Mack, former sheriff of Graham County, Arizona, and the upcoming challenger for Smith's House seat, called Smith a  RINO . [2]

Lamar Smith is married to Elizabeth Lynn Schaefer. He has two sons from his previous marriage. Smith is a  Christian Scientist .
