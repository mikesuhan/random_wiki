The  Alternative Media  is media including  blogs ,  newspapers  and  talkback radio , which present different viewpoints on news when compared to the  mainstream media . The perspectives they provide are often free from the  liberal bias  that is present in the Mainstream Media, the term references media that is not in the pocket of mainstream liberal media. Alternative media tends to be conservative like  Rush Limbaugh , libertarian like  Alex Jones , and/or Christian like  The Christian Post , though in rare cases some liberal alternative media outlets exist such as  The Young Turks . The conservative website  Drudge Report  is one of the longest running alternative news aggregates online.

Several mainstream corporate-backed and/or taxpayer-funded masquerade as alternative, including  The Nation  and  Village Voice .
