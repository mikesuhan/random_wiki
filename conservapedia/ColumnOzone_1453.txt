Column ozone  is  ozone  between the Earth's surface and outer space.
Ozone levels can be described in several ways. One of the most common measures is how much ozone is in a vertical column of air. The  Dobson unit  is a measure of column ozone. Other measures include partial pressure, number density, and concentration of ozone, and can represent either column ozone or the amount of ozone at a particular altitude.
