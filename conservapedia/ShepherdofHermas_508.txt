The  Shepherd of Hermas  is a  Christian  text that circulated in the early Christian church. It records a series of visions relayed by a  slave  named Hermas.  Hermas is shown a series of allegorical images representing the Church, and then sees a vision of an  angel  who appears in the form of a  shepherd , and teaches Hermas a system of commandments and  ethical  teachings.  While generally viewed favorably, it was ultimately excluded from the  Biblical canon  as not having been written by an  Apostle .

The Shepherd of Hermas is only seen as canonical by the  Ethiopian Orthodox Church .
