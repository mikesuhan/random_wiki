The  intermediate scrutiny  test in constitutional law is applied to statutes that affect quasi-suspect classifications such as making distinctions based on gender.  This test requires invalidating a statute that discriminates based on gender unless the government can prove that the statute is substantially related to an important government purpose.

If the  Equal Rights Amendment  had passed, then the  strict scrutiny  test would be applied to all gender-related laws and rules, and that test is almost impossible to pass.
