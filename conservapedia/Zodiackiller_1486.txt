The  Zodiac killer  is the pseudonym given to a notorious unidentified serial killer, active in the late 1960s in California, originating in the  San Francisco  area. The name originated in one of a series taunting letters sent to the police claiming to have been written by the killer. Though he has only 7 confirmed victims, in one of the last letters sent to the police, he claimed over 37 victims. Of the many letters he sent to the police, 4 where cyphers, 3 of which have yet to be solved. The police have stated that it is likely the letters where written by the killer, as he provided details about the crimes in some of them that where not yet released to the public.
