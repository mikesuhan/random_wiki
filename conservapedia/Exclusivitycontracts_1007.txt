Exclusivity contracts  are subject to scrutiny under  antitrust law .

In  Potters Medical Center v. City Hospital Association , 800 F.2d 568 (6th Cir. 1986), the court allowed a plaintiff hospital to sue a rival hospital in order to compel it to end its anticompetitive practice of denying hospital privileges to physicians who simultaneously held hospital privileges with plaintiff.

When a plaintiff "seeks to forbid exclusivity - first on its own behalf and implicitly on behalf of others," the plaintiff does state an antitrust injury because it seeks "to destroy an anticompetitive arrangement." 2 Areeda, Hovenkamp & Blair, Antitrust Law P 348e, at 401.
