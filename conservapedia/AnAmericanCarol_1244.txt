An American Carol  is a movie by director David Zucker released on October 3, 2008. It is a rare comedy made in Hollywood by conservatives, for conservatives. It is a gag-filled lampoon of  liberals  about a cynical, Anti-American “Hollywood” documentary filmmaker leading a slapstick campaign to abolish the  Fourth of July . It stars Kevin Farley, brother of the late  Chris Farley , as a scruffy  Michael Moore  parody named Michael Malone.  An American Carol  mixes the narrative of Charles Dickens's  A Christmas Carol  with Fox News fodder. [1]  Many highly recognized Hollywood actors star in the film including  Kelsey Grammer ,  Dennis Hopper ,  Jon Voight , Robert Davi, and Leslie Nielsen with Cameo appearances by  Bill O'Reilly , James Woods and  Paris Hilton .

Besides spoofing  Michael Moore ,  An American Carol  roasts  jihadists ,  Rosie O'Donnell , college professors,  Neville Chamberlain ,  Adolf Hitler , President  Jimmy Carter , chanting protesters and the  ACLU . Zucker co-wrote the film with Myrna Sokoloff and Lewis Friedman. Zucker directed the previous hit comedies  Airplane! ,  The Naked Gun  and  Scary Movie 3  &  4 .
