David A. Scott  (born June 27, 1946), a  Democrat , is  U.S. Representative from  Georgia 's 13th congressional district, which includes downtown Atlanta. The district is about half and half black and white. His campaign manager is  Hank Aaron , Scott's brother-in-law and a famous baseball star.

Scott is a member of the conservative  Blue Dog  Coalition and scores ratings from the Chamber of Commerce from 70 to 80, and from the American Conservative Union in the 30s.  In 2003 he was one of only seven Democrats who voted for Bush's tax cuts, and he voted for a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage.

Scott, a lifelong Baptist, was born in Aynor, S.C. but grew up in several states. He has a B.A. from Florida A&M, (1967) and an MBA from the prestigious Wharton School (1969). A successful businessman, he has owned an advertising agency since 1979, and is known for slick election campagn ads. He was elected to the Georgia state house of representatives (1974-1982) and the Georgia state senate, (1982-2002). He has been elected to Congress every two years since 2002.

On August 6, 2009 Scott lost his temper at a townhall meeting over  health care  after being asked tough questions over health care reform. Scott then accused his audience of not even being constituents in his district.

He then yelled at the audience " not one single one of you had the decency to call my office and set up for a meeting. Do that! You wanna meeting with me on healthcare, I’ll give you one. "

The man asking the questions was Dr. Brian E. Hill, an opponent of government-run health care, who was in fact a constituent and contacted Scott’s office on numerous occasions asking whether his representative is going to host any healthcare events. He was told no. [1]
