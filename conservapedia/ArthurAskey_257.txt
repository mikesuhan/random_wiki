Arthur Bowden Askey  (1900-1982) - 'Big-Hearted Arthur' - was a British entertainer and comedian who was a popular star of radio comedy during the mid twentieth century. Born in Liverpool, he joined the army in  World War I  and gained entertainment experience in army concert parties; after the war (and a stint working in local government) he became a music hall entertainer. In 1938 he got his big break with the radio comedy programme  Band Waggon  with Richard Murdoch: the conceit of the show was that Askey and 'Stinker' Murdoch lived in a flat on the roof of the BBC's Broadcasting House. He appeared in several films, and following the war also became a much-respected television performer, though never achieving the heights of success that he had achieved in radio. His catchphrases were "Hello Playmates" and "Aye thang yew" ('I thank you'); and he is also remembered for his rendition of  The Bee Song :

Oh what a glorious thing to be,

A healthy grown up busy busy bee,

Whiling away

The passing hours

Pinching all the pollen

From the cauliflow'rs.
