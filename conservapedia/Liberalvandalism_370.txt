Liberal vandalism  is the destructive,  anarchist  behavior of targeting anything  conservative  as a means to further the liberal cause. Liberals like to talk about tolerance but their actions can be intolerant of opposing positions. The offenses of  liberal   vandals  entail everything from malicious intent to  libel  of a conservative or can go as far as breaking the law.

Online Wikis such as  Conservapedia  often publish articles which contradict a typical liberal's opinions, which could lead to liberal vandalism. Liberal vandalism on wikis can manifest in multiple ways; a liberal might insert parodic or nonsensical content into an article, or they might simply delete content from the article, partially or entirely. Despite understanding that their edits would be reverted and their user accounts would be blocked, liberal vandals continue to vandalize online wikis.

Conservapedia  is freqently vandalized by liberals for challenging their worldview, leading them to insert explicit or misleading content into articles. The vandalism inserted into Conservapedia can mislead readers who don't understand the nature of Wikis into believing that the encyclopedia is "just wacko," despite that not being the case, according to Brian Macdonald, a Conservapedia user who reverts vandalism.
