Money  is defined as something which serves as a means of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account and represents only an extremely small fraction of the real wealth of any given society or  country  where it is used. The  currency  which serves as money may be backed by some tangible commodity, such as the  gold standard , or may be  fiat money , such as  Federal Reserve  notes. Alternatively, trade may be carried on using commodity pay, wherein existing commodities are assigned exchange values but not explicitly designated as money.

The earliest discovered forms of money were easily carried items with some inherent value, such as  salt  (used in ancient  Rome ) and fishhooks (used by  American Indians ). This replaced or supplemented pre-existing  barter  systems. Precious metals, such as  copper ,  gold , and  silver , have made good coins, being both easily transportable and having inherent value. In 1933, the  United States  abandoned the  gold standard , [1]  switching over to  fiat currency , which has no inherent value beyond the government's assurance that it has value.

Money may be viewed as neutral or non-neutral regarding the real  economy ; it is disputed whether changes in the money market cause changes in real markets. The money market itself consists of a money supply (typically fixed for any given period) and a demand function for money. Because the quantity of money is typically exogenously given, the only variable determined in the money market is the price of money.
