The  Medieval warm period , an era when it was much warmer than global temperatures today, lasted roughly from 1000 to 1300 A.D. - a full 400â€“700 years before humans began pumping out those 'deadly  greenhouse gases .' [1] 
 Willie Soon  and  Sallie Baliunas  of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics "found 112 studies containing information about the medieval warm period [in] Russia, the U.S. Corn Belt, Central Plains and Southwest; much of China and Japan; southern Africa; Argentina, Chile and Peru in South America, Australia and Antarctica ... in the Indian Ocean, both central and southern; and in the Central and Western Pacific Ocean. In the Southern Hemisphere, twenty-one of twenty-two studies (95 percent) showed evidence of the Medieval Warming."  [1]

Nonetheless, AGW advocate  Michael Mann  said it was limited to "Europe and neighboring regions or the North Atlantic".  [2]
