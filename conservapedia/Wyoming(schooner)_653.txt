Wyoming  was the largest wooden  schooner  ever built, a wooden six-masted  gaff-rigged  schooner. Built and completed in 1909 by the firm of Percy & Small in Bath, she was also one of the largest wooden ships ever built being 450Â ft long.

Due to her length, she was prone to flex (nautical term "hog") in high seas thus taking on water. She sank in 1924 with the loss of all hands.
