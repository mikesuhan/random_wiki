Feminist Re-definition  aims to advance the   feminist agenda  by creating neologisms and re-defining words to introduce gender-neutrality (and gender inclusiveness) to language.

Other examples include the  feminist censorship  of words such as "chairman" in favor of "chairperson", and the support of the adoption of gender-inclusive pronouns such as "eir" (for both "his" and "her").
