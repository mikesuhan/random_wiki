For over a century, school textbooks taught students that the  Theory of Evolution  was illustrated by similarities between the development of a human in the womb compared to the shape of embryos of lower life forms. [1]   In other words, human development supposedly imitated the evolutionary path of life on earth.

This theory was initially proposed by  Charles Darwin  in  The Origin of Species  and then heavily promoted by the German Darwinist,  Ernst Haeckel .  In 1904, Haeckel reiterated a view of Darwin:  "These lower races ... are psychologically nearer to the mammals (apes or dogs) than to civilized Europeans; we must, therefore, assign a totally different value to their lives."   [2]

Haeckel drew diagrams suggesting that an animal, including a human, imitates the shapes of its ancestors' evolution as it develops in the womb.  He then drew fraudulent images to popularize his theory.  The drawings, shown to the right here, were a complete fake. [3]

The Haeckel diagrams remained in school textbooks long after scientists privately recognized they were  fraudulent .  The diagrams were not removed from textbooks until the New York Times publicized the fraud in 2001. [4]

Noted evolutionist  Stephen Gould  wrote the following regarding Ernst Haeckel's work in a March 2000 issue of  Natural History :

Even after creationists repeatedly pointed out the fraudulent nature of these drawings, the evolutionists continue to use them in biology exams to this day. The biology paper in the Higher School Certificate exam on 19 October 2012, a major public matriculation exam in New South Wales, Australia, contained a question featuring Haeckel’s fraudulent embryo drawings. [6]

Stephen Gould continues by quoting Michael Richardson of the St. George’s Hospital Medical School in London, who stated: "I know of at least fifty recent biology texts which use the drawings uncritically". [7]

Creationists have written regarding the fraudulent nature of Haeckel's work and how a prestigious German science journal published his dubious work. [8] [9]

Ernst Haeckel attempted to portray himself as an ethical proponent of  atheism , however, history shows he was a  deceitful atheist . [10] [11] [12] 
 [13] [14] 
The March 9, 1907 edition of the NY Times refers to Ernst Haeckel as the "celebrated Darwinian and founder of the Association for the Propagation of Ethical Atheism." [15]
