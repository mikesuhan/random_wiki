Traditionalist Catholicism  is a  religious  movement that has been in existence since the  Second Ecumenical Council of the Vatican  in 1962. Traditionalist Catholics reject the changes made in the Church by Vatican II and support a return to pre-Vatican II liturgy and/or theology.

Some traditionalist Catholics reject the papal successions since either 1958 or 1962.
