Eugene Franklin Coleman  was an American citizen who maintained a covert relationship with Soviet Naval Military Intelligence (Naval  GRU ) during  World War II .

Coleman was an electrical engineer working in  New Jersey  for an RCA laboratory that developed devices to assist in radio navigation for high-altitude aerial bombardment.  Venona project  transcripts indicate that Coleman was an important Soviet agent.  According to one cable Coleman was writing the manual for precision equipment. Coleman also was involved in recruiting activities on behalf of Soviet Naval GRU.  Coleman provided information on four other  Communist  engineers working for various Defense contractors, including background information.  Naval GRU asked the KGB in Washington to check up on these potential recruits because of its limited staff.

Coleman is the subject of six Venona messages. In August 1942 the Naval GRU sent a query to the  Comintern  asking for any information it had about Coleman; it described him as an employee for a telephone company and a Communist.  Decrypts show naval GRU was still considering his recruitment in early 1943 and made a decision to recruit Coleman go in July 1943.

Coleman was never subpoenaed to testify before an investigating U.S. Congressional Committee.
