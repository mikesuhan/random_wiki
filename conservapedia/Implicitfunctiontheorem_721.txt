The  Implicit function theorem  is a  theorem  of  calculus . It states that a (multiple- variable ) function has many  inverses  hidden in different  neighborhoods  of the  image . That is to say, the  graph  of the function can be finitely  partitioned  so that each piece has an inverse function. It is used by  mathematicians  for local analysis of functions which cannot be globally inverted. It is considered one of the fundaments of the Calculus and does not require  complex analysis  for proof.
