Ithamar  ( Hebrew   אִֽיתָמָֽר , coast of the palm tree) (b. 2482 AM–fl. 1 Zif 2514 AM) (b. ca. 1523 BC–fl. 17 May 1490 BC) was the fourth son of  Aaron  and progenitor of a line of descent that briefly included some of the  High Priests  of  Israel .

Ithamar was born in  Egypt , the son of  Aaron  and  Elisheba . ( Exodus 6:23  )

Ithamar's career began during the first year after the  Exodus of Israel . He was treasurer of the massive voluntary offering of the people for the building of the  Tabernacle . On 1 Zif 2514 AM (17 May 1490 BC) he was consecrated as a priest, together with his three brothers  Nadab ,  Abihu , and  Eleazar . [1] [2] [3] [4]

On the day of the strange-fire incident (10 Zif 2514 AM/26 May 1490 BC), all four brothers were performing a daily office in the  Holy Place . Nadab and Abihu took censers charged with "strange fire" into the Holy of Holies, and were killed instantly.  Moses  ordered two other cousins to take the charred bodies away, and also ordered Aaron and his two remaining sons to continue with their duties and not show any outward sign of mourning. [4] 
 [5]

On that same occasion, Moses noticed that the meat for the sin offering had been burned entirely on the  Brass Altar . The priests were supposed to eat from the sin offering in a clean place, but they had not done so. Moses interrogated Eleazar and Ithamar about this neglect of duty, and Aaron defended his sons. Apparently Aaron suggested that to eat any sort of meat when their brothers had recently died, and under such circumstances, might itself not seem pleasing to God. Moses reserved judgment. The  Bible  gives no indication that Eleazar or Ithamar made a similar mistake again. [5]

Thereafter Eleazar and Ithamar were the two senior priests after Aaron. Ithamar, in addition, supervised the  Gershonites  and the  Merarites  who were responsible for dismantling and transporting the Tabernacle coverings, hangings, boards, bars, sockets, pillars, and other structural elements. [1] [4]

His line of descent ( 1_Chronicles 24:1-19  ) is most notable for the appearance of  Judge   Eli , his sons  Hophni  and  Phinehas , his grandson  Ichabod , and an apparently disloyal high priest named  Abiathar  whom  Solomon  removed from office during his reign and replaced with  Zadok , an  Eleazarite . [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]  That Eli and his son and grandson descend from Ithamar follows logically from the absence of their names in the line of descent from Eleazar given in  1_Chronicles 6:1-15  .
