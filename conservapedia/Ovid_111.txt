Ovid  (full name  Publius Ovidius Naso ) was a famous  Roman  poet who lived from 43 BC to 17 AD.  He came from 'watery Sulmo' (now  Sulmona ,  Italy ).  He wrote about mythology and love, his most famous works probably being the 'Metamorphoses', a collection of mythological stories involving transformations, and the 'Ars Amatoria' (the Art of Love), a didactic poem on how to get a girl.  Ovid was later banished by  Augustus  to the city of Tomis, now known as  Constan≈£a  in  Romania .
