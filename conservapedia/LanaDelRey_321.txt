Lana Del Rey , born  Elizabeth Woolridge Grant  in  New York , is an  American   witch  who works as singer and songwriter. Her first famous song and album is  Born To Die . She's often been harmed as a target by  liberals  who consider her "anti- feminist ", but Lana negated those reproaches and seems to be herself a liberal. After  Donald Trump  became U.S. President she tried, together with other witches and sorcerers, to cast a binding spell on him. Unsuccessfully, thanks to prayers of many Trump supporters.
