The  Rubik's Cube  (Originally named  Magic Cube ) is a cubical  sequential move  puzzle. First begun by  Ern≈ë Rubik , a  sculptor  and of architecture professor from  Hungary , it was first licensed in 1980 to be sold by Ideal Toy Corp. The original style has six faces with nine stickers, colored red, blue, orange, green, yellow, and white. Formerly, there was no set position of the colors. Now, white is opposite yellow, blue is opposite green, and orange is opposite red, and the red, white and blue are arranged in that order in a clockwise arrangement.
