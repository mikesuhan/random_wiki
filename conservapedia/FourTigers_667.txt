The  Four Tigers  or the  Asian Tigers  are the prosperous economies of four Pacific Rim regions:   Hong Kong ,  Singapore ,  Taiwan  and  South Korea .  Since the 1960s their economies have rapidly developed by selling high value goods to developed nations.  They did this in part by purchasing American Treasuries ensuring a lower value to their local curriency making their exports seem cheaper, and by putting in place  tariffs  to prevent incoming goods.  Education was another important aspect of their growth to ensure that the workforces were well educated and ultimately more productive.
