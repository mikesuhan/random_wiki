The  River Tees  is a major river in northern  England . It rises on Cross Fell in  Cumbria  and flows through  County Durham , north  Yorkshire  and  Cleveland  before entering the  North Sea  at  Redcar . In its upper reaches it flows through the upland country of the North  Pennines . Its middle reaches flow through agricultural countryside. The lower reaches of the Tees - from  Stockton on Tees  to the sea pass through a heavily industrialised landscape.  Teesside  (Stockton, Thornaby,  Middlesbrough  and neighbouring settlements) was the site of coal export facilities, shipbuilding, chemicals manufacture and iron and steel making; and chemicals and steel are still the industrial mainstay of the area.
