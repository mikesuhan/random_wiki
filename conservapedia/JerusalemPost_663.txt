The  Jerusalem Post  is a daily  English - language   Israeli   newspaper , founded on December 1, 1932, by U.S.-born journalist  Gershon Agron  as the  Palestine Post .  The newspaper's name was changed in 1950, two years after the state of  Israel  was declared and the  Mandate of Palestine  ended.

Before 1989, the  Jerusalem Post  supported the  Israeli Labor Party  and was generally considered  left-wing .  In 1989 it was purchased by  Canadian   conservative  newspaper magnate   Conrad Black , after which the paper became more supportive of Israel's  right-wing   Likud Party .
