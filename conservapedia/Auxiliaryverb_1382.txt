An  auxiliary verb  is a  verb  that combines with a non-finite form (e.g., a  participle  or  infinitive ) of another verb.  The auxiliary verb expresses such things as  tense ,  mood ,  voice , and  aspect , while the other verb provides the lexical meaning.  For example, in "I had been walking," "had" is an auxiliary verb indicating the tense, "been" is an auxiliary verb indicating the aspect, and "walking" is a participle of a lexical verb identifying the action.
