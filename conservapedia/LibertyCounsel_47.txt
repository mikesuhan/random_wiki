Liberty Counsel  is a 501(c)(3) organization providing pro bono assistance to advancing religious freedom, the sanctity of life, and the family since 1989. Liberty Counsel is a  Christian  organization affiliated with Liberty University. They do not limit its services to Christians. They rely on tax-deductible donations from concerned individuals, churches and organizations. Liberty Counsel has offices in  Florida ,  Virginia ,  Texas ,  Washington, D.C. , and Jerusalem,  Israel . Mathew D. Staver is founder and Chairman.

They publish the newsletter 'The Liberator' and offer training, education and public policy program through the Liberty Center for Law & Policy. From 1989 to 2004, they won 86% of their litigations. Since 2004, Liberty Counsel has won 92% of their cases. [1]

Because of its support for  freedom of religion ,  freedom of speech  and  traditional values  and its opposition to  abortion , Liberty Counsel has been the target of baseless attacks by far-Left hate group the  Southern Poverty Law Center . In response to the SPLC's attacks, Liberty Counsel has accused the SPLC of enabling terrorism via its so-called "hate map" and its false inclusion of Christian ministries and conservative groups on that list, which domestic homosexual terrorist Floyd Lee Corkins cited as his motivation for his attack on the  Family Research Council 's head office on August 15, 2012, with the intent of killing as many FRC employees as possible (which was thankfully prevented by office security guard Leonardo Johnson and led to a lengthy prison sentence for Corkins).
