A  climate model  is a simplified numerical simulation of the  climate .

Climate scientists attempt to validate or prove the skill of the models by tuning them to match observations of the climate.

All the models are claimed to have good agreement with the 20th century temperature trends, yet are acknowledged to have significant errors.

Currently the most advanced climate models, still disagree by more than a factor of two in their sensitivity to greenhouse gas forcing, and have significant disagreements with observed climate behavior at high latitudes.

They are, therefore, utterly unable to project the change of climate in response to future greenhouse gas scenarios.

The climate is generally not considered predictable, because not all the internal processes of the climate are well understood.
