A politician, organization, or person's  pro-life score  reflects how sincere and effective they are at advancing the lawful goals of the  pro-life  principles.

The higher the score, on a scale from 0 to 100, the greater their life-enhancing value.   Jesus  would have a pro-life score of 100% in light of his advocacy and works in support of life.
