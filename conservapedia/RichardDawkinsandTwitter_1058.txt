Despite the medical advice of his doctors,  Richard Dawkins  had a very active Twitter presence before his minor stroke (with a number of Twitter controversies) and numerous public controversies. [1]

Dawkins has  accumulated over 30,000 Twitter tweets. [2]   The Independent  reported, "Dawkins also admitted he wasn't very good at managing Twitter and the strong reactions his posts tend to provoke. 'Twitter is very difficult medium to handle,' he said. 'Iâ€™m not much of a diplomat.'" [3]   However, after his stroke, in May 2016, Dawkins  gave up posting on Twitter for awhile and the tweets that appeared in his name were done by his staff. [4]

In March of 2017, Dawkins appears to have started to Tweet again despite his doctors warnings to avoid controversy (For example, he tweeted that Britain had become a "nasty little backwater" after the  Brexit  vote and his Tweet drew fierce criticism). [5]

In short, Dawkins has repeatedly ignored the medical advice of his doctors and appears to continue to do so.
