Multidrug resistance  is a condition enabling a disease-causing organism to resist certain  drugs  or  chemicals  targeted at eradicating the organisms. Organisms that display multi drug resistance can be pathologic cells, including bacterial and/or neoplastic (tumor) cells. Evidence has shown that bacteria with multiple resistances had undergone  microevolution  and activated mutated genes that were once inactive but occurred in the wild population. This is strong evidence for the theory of  intelligent design .
