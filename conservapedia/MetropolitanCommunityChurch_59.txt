The  Metropolitan Community Church [1]  (MCC) is a faux  Christian   church  that openly accepts  homosexuals .

While some  liberal  churches have accepted homosexuals to various degrees, the MCC is unique in that it was founded by Reverend Troy Perry, a minister forced to leave his  Church of God  position for homosexuality, expressly to cater to homosexuals.
