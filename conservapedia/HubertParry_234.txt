Sir Charles  Hubert  Hastings  Parry  (1848-1914), English composer and teacher, is considered, with  Charles Villiers Stanford , to have had a crucial role in the flowering of English art music in the first decades of the 20th century, and helped give it increased significance in the cultural life of the nation.

He first composed when he was eight, completed a BA (Music) degree at  Oxford University  whilst still at school, was active from a young age in the various musical festivals around the country and became a leading light in the musical activities of the capital. He taught at the Royal Academy of Music from the mid 1890s and would be its director. He was appointed Professor of Music at Oxford in 1900. He wrote books on music that are still in print. He was knighted and made a baronet in 1902

Unlike Stanford and others he showed little interest in folk music – his compositions broke no new ground and reflected European tradition – however, the “Oxford Companion to Music” mentions a “ Miltonian  character” in his work, where “typical national qualities markedly express themselves”. He wrote too much, was always too busy, for his work to be of a uniformly high standard (and his physical life was as hectic as his musical – he ran and climbed and swam and usually was recovering some recently self-inflicted accidental injury.)

Some works, though, have remained, and hold their place.
