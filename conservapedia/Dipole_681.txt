A  dipole  is a molecule which has two  magnetic  poles, caused by a non-zero total magnetic charge. The poles are normally denoted  north  and  south , respectively. Common dipole molecules are  water ,  ozone  (but not atmospheric  oxygen  O 2 ), and  benzene .

As is well known, oil and water do not mix.  This is because most or all oil molecules have a different molecular polarity than water.
