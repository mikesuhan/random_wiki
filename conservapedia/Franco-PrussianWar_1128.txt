The  Franco-Prussian War  of 1870-1871 (also called  Franco-German war  or  1870 war ) was the result of  Otto von Bismarck 's plan to unify Germany. It was fought by the  North German Federation  (led by  Prussia ), and the southern  German  states of  Baden ,  Wuerttemberg , and  Bavaria   against  France under emperor  Napoleon III . It involved a winter-time siege of Paris and ended with the  Treaty of Frankfurt . The main result of the war was the secession of the  France  regions of Alsace and Lorraine to Prussia. This in turn led to a simmering resentment of  Germany  in  France  which in turn contributed to French public support for  World War One  as a means to win back the lands ceded to Germany.
