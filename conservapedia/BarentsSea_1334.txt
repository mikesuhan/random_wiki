The  Barents Sea  forms part of the  Arctic Ocean . It lies to the north of northern  Norway  and the  Kola Peninsula  of north-west  Russia , and is bounded to the east by  Novaya Zemlya  and to the north (approximately) by the  Franz-Joseph Land  and  Svalbard   archipelagos . The sea was renamed after the  Dutch  explorer  Willem Barents  (c.1550-1597) in 1853; it had previously been known as the Murmean Sea.
