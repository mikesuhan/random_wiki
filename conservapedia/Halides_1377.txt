Halides  are  compounds  in which a  halogen   element , e.g.  chlorine ,  fluorine ,  iodine , or  bromine , is the sole  anion . Halides include compounds such as  halite  ( sodium chloride , NaCl). These  minerals  are relatively soft, weak, and  brittle ; many of them will  dissolve  readily in  water . Those that are not  soluble  in water generally  crystallize  in the  isometric   crystal system  and develop as  cubes .
