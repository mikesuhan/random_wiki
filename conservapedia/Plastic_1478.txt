Plastic  is a durable, (sometimes) recyclable  polymer  material formed from  oil  that is nearly ubiquitous in American consumer products.  Plastics were discovered in the mid-1900s, and entered into wide use almost as quickly.

Plastic can be divided by mechanical-thermal behavior in Thermoplastic, Thermosetting polymer and Elastomer. Thermoplastic consists of long linear molecules that are not interlinked. They are easily deformable and sensitive to heat. Thermosetting polymer consists of strong interlinked molecules and cannot be deformed. Elastomers consist of entangled molecules and can be pulled.
