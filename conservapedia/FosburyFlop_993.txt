The  Fosbury flop  is a technique popular among athletes who compete in the high jump. The inventor, Dick Fosbury, used the technique to win an  Olympic  gold medal in 1968. It is an example of a  conservative innovation  that  liberals  have tried to claim as their own after initially rejecting it because it defied their hidebound, regulated way of thinking.
