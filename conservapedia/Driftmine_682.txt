A  drift mine  is a type of coal mine that is driven horizontally into  coal  that is exposed or accessible in a hillside.

In a  hydraulic mine , high-pressure water jets break the  coal  from a steeply inclined, thick coal bed that would be difficult to mine with the usual underground methods. The  coal  is then transported to the surface by a system of flumes or by pipeline.

Although currently not in commercial use in the  United States , hydraulic mining is used in western  Canada .
