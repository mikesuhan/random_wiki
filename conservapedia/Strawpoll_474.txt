A  straw poll  is a non-binding poll of the votes or preferences of members of a political convention.  Often a "straw poll" is used to indicate who the leading candidates are in an upcoming election. The name "straw poll" came from the 17th century writer John Selden, who said: "Take a straw and throw it up into the airâ€”you may see by that which way the wind is." [1]

A straw poll emphasizes the quantity of votes over quality.  They are generally highly unreliable.  For example, an online poll might ask viewers to click a button that corresponds to their opinion.  Such a poll would be unreliable because nothing is known about the people who vote and they can vote over and over again. [2]
