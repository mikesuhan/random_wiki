Containment  was the policy of the  United States  after  World War II  to assist small countries in their resistance against  communism .  The idea was to counter act the  Soviet  pressures so that communism would not spread further.

The term was coined by diplomat  George F. Kennan  in 1946, in an anonymous article written to the journal  Foreign Affairs , titled  The Sources of Soviet Conduct .  Kennan argued that the Soviet Union suffered from paranoia and fear of foreign invasion, and thus would seek to build a network of buffer states.  However, Soviet leaders were also inherently risk averse and would quickly back down when confronted with an American show of force.

Containment was a major part of the  Truman Doctrine , laid out in 1947 and first applied in Greece and Turkey.
