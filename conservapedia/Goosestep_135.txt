The  goose step  is a type of marching step performed in formal military parades and special ceremonies. While marching in parade formation, the goose step is performed by troops through swinging their legs in unison off the ground, while keeping each leg straight and unbent.

Because of the goose steps association with  Nazi  Germany, the  Soviet Union , blind obedience and dictatorships, it has acquired a negative reputation in the Anglo-American world. Anglo-Americans commonly mock goose stepping.

George Orwell  wrote in "England Your England" (1946):

It is simply an affirmation of naked power; contained in it, quite consciously and intentionally, is the vision of a boot crashing down on a face.

Its ugliness is part of its essence, for what it is saying is ‘Yes, I am ugly, and you daren’t laugh at me’, like the bully who makes faces at his victim.

Why is the goose-step not used in England?

There are, heaven knows, plenty of army officers who would be only too glad to introduce some such thing.

It is not used because the people in the street would laugh.

Beyond a certain point, military display is only possible in countries where the common people dare not laugh at the army. [1]
