Arthur Glenn Andrews  (January 15, 1909 - September 25, 2008), usually known as  Glenn Andrews , was at the time of his death the oldest living former member of the  United States House of Representatives . An  Alabama   Republican , Andrews represented the former Fourth Congressional District (since Third District) centered about his birthplace of Anniston, the seat of Calhoun County in the northern portion of his state. Andrews became the oldest former member on November 10, 2007, with the passing of former U.S. Representative Augustus Hawkins, a  California   Democrat .

Andrews attended John Herbert Phillips High School in Birmingham, Alabama. He subsequently graduated from Mercersburg Academy, a boarding school in Mercersburg,  Pennsylvania . In 1931, he received a  Bachelor of Arts  degree from  Princeton University  in Princeton,  New Jersey . He was associated with National City Bank of New York, 1931-1933;  International Business Machines , 1933-1936; district manager of an  Eastman Kodak  subsidiary, 1936-1946; and was an advertising executive, from 1946-1970, excluding his single term in Congress.

Andrews was a Democratic candidate for the Alabama House of Representatives in 1956 and for Alabama secretary of state in 1958. Having switched parties, he was a delegate to the 1964 Republican National Convention held in  San Francisco , where he was committed to the party's presidential nominee, then U.S. Senator  Barry Goldwater  of  Arizona . He was elected to Congress on the Goldwater ticket, which easily prevailed over an unpledged elector slate in Alabama. U.S. President  Lyndon B. Johnson  was not listed on the Alabama ballot. Andrews defeated Democrat Kenneth A. Roberts, 40,143 (58.6 percent) to 27,800 (40.6 percent).

Four other Alabama Republicans were elected to the U.S. House with Andrews: James Douglas Martin of Gadsden, John Hall Buchanan, Jr., of Birmingham, William Dickinson of Montgomery, and Jack Edwards of Mobile. The 1964 elections were the first single-member district contests for Congress in modern Alabama history; previously the state had elected congressional members at-large, and a voter was required to mark a candidate for all available slots, or his ballot was voided. The GOP held the Buchanan seat until 1983 and still holds the former Dickinson and Edwards seats. Martin's seat reverted to the Democrats in the 1966 elections when Martin made an unsuccessful bid for governor.

Andrews served only in the 87th Congress. He and other Alabama members opposed the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965, which passed after a controversial African American-led demonstration from Selma to the sate capital at  Montgomeryy . In 1966, Andrews was defeated for reelection by about the same margin that he had won in 1964. He was unseated by the Democratic State Senator William Flynt "Bill" Nichols (1918-1988), a protege of Alabama Governor  George Wallace , who successful ran his wife, Lurleen Burns Wallace as his gubernatorial successor in the same general election. Nichols received 54,515 votes (58.7 percent) to Andrews' 38,402 (41.3 percent). Nichols served for eleven terms, having died shortly before  Christmas  1988, just a month after his election for a twelfth term. Nichols was succeeded by fellow Democrat Glen Browder, the winner of a special election in 1989.

For a time, Andrews chaired the Alabama Fourth Congressional District Republican Executive Committee. He sought to return to Congress in the 1970 general election, when Wallace ran unopposed for a second term as governor. Andrews was then overwhelmingly defeated by Nichols, 77,701 votes (83.7 percent) to 13,217 (14.2 percent).

President  Richard M. Nixon  appointed Andrews a trustee in bankruptcy court, a position which he held from 1973 until 1985.
