She won 16 Grand Slam women's doubles titles, 12 Grand Slam singles titles, and 11 Grand Slam mixed doubles titles. She participated in the "Battle of the Sexes" exhibition match in 1973, defeating former  Wimbledon  men's champion  Bobby Riggs  who by then was well into his 50s.  After the match, in an act of tennis chivalry, Riggs jumped over the net to shake King's hand.
