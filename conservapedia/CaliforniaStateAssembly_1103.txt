The  California State Assembly  serves as the lower house of the  California State Legislature , meeting at the State Capitol in  Sacramento . The Assembly has twice as many members as the Senate, which makes it harder for individual members to affect legislation. Democrats have controlled the body for 39 years, rendering the minority impotent on some issues.

Article IV, Section 7 of the  California Constitution  allows each legislative house to select its own officers. The Assembly has chosen to elect a Speaker as its leader, with each party allowed to select a floor leader.

The current and 67th Speaker is  Karen Bass , the first female to hold that office. Alberto Torrico and Sam Blakeslee serve as Majority and Minority Leaders, respectively.
