In 1942 Adolf Hitler declared:

After  World War II , the War Crimes Tribunal indicted ten  Nazi  leaders for "encouraging and compelling abortion," which the tribunal considered a "crime against humanity." [2] [3]

Then from 1938 to 1945, this surgical treatment of such ‘useless eaters’ was superceded by a more comprehensive solution—the eager genocide, by Hitler’s  Nazis , of over 11 million people considered to be subhuman or unworthy of life, as is authenticated and documented by the Nuremberg Trials records. Those killed included  Jews , evangelical  Christians , blacks, gypsies,  communists ,  homosexuals , amputees and mental patients.

This was nothing other than rampant  Darwinism  — the elimination of millions of human beings branded ‘unfit/inferior’ by, and for the benefit of, those who regarded themselves as being ‘fit/superior’.

The core idea of Darwinism is  selection . The Nazis believed that they must direct the process of selection to advance the German race. Galton’s naïve vision of a ‘ eugenics   utopia ’ had mutated into the Nazi nightmare of murderous ethnic cleansing.

Sadly, ideas of racial superiority and eugenics did not die with Hitler’s regime.  David Duke , America’s infamous anti-black and anti-Jew racist, developed his views from reading the eugenicist writings of Galton,  H.G. Wells , Sir Arthur Keith and others, as well as the early writings of modern sociobiologists such as Harvard’s E.O. Wilson. [4]

In  Nazi Germany , abortion resulted in the death penalty for  Aryan  women, but was forced upon other "inferior" members of society. Abortion played a prominent part in Nazi  eugenics , "cleansing" those seen as undesirable. The Nazis believed the woman's body belonged to the state, and they would decide whether a pregnancy would be carried out. Jews, Gypsies, and other groups would be killed if they did not carry out a state-mandated abortion.
