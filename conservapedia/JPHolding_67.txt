James Patrick Holding, commonly referred to as  JP Holding , is a Florida-based  Christian apologist  and president of Tekton Education and Apologetics Ministry which provides answers to questions which are often posed regarding the  Christian  faith. Tekton Apologetics Ministries is one of the leading apologetics ministries on the Internet with over 17,000 articles. [1]  JP Holding holds a master's degree in Library Science. [2]

JP Holding is the author of two books  The Impossible Faith  and  Mormon Defenders . [3] [4]  Holding's book  The Impossible Faith  affirms that  Christianity  could not have succeeded without indisputable proof of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. [5]    Holding's book  The Impossible Faith  originally started out as an essay and can be found on his website. [6]   An  atheist  paid $5,000 to have  Richard Carrier  write a work which argued against Holding's essay  The Impossible Faith . [7] [8]   JP Holding states in his essay  The Impossible Faith  that he:

Below I offer a list of 17 factors to be considered -- places where Christianity "did the wrong thing" in order to be a successful religion. It is my contention that the only way Christianity did succeed is because it was a truly revealed faith -- and because it had the irrefutable witness of the resurrection. [9]

The Mormon Defenders  argues that the case for a Biblical  Mormonism  is rooted in misinterpretations of the Bible. [10]

Among other things, Mr. Holding's website Tekton Apologetics Ministries offers many articles which defend the doctrine of Bible inerrancy concerning various  Bible  verses. [11]  In addition, JP Holding has written articles for the Christian Research Journal and the Creation Ex Nihilo Technical Journal. [12]

He holds to the belief that Biblical literalism or fundamentalism is a corrupt form of faith born of ignorance. This can be seen in many of his Tektonics YouTube videos where "fundies" as he calls them are given the same disdain as atheists.
