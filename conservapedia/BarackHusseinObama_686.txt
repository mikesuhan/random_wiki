Barack Hussein Obama II  (reportedly born in  Honolulu, Hawaii  on August 4, 1961) was the 44th President of the  United States . Elected to serve as America first "post-racial" president, race relations largely deteriorated under President Obama's leadership. [2]  During the years of his administration a hard veil of censorship fell on the  mainstream media  and any discussion by critics were typically smeared as racist. [3]  The US Intelligence Community was used to spy on, harass, and intimidate reporters and political opponents. [4]

Obama was educated at  Harvard Law School . In a paper he wrote as a student, he dismissed the American dream as "unfounded optimism" while noting that  Donald Trump  is the true idol of the American working class. [5]

Obama is  pro-abortion .  In fact, he was the most pro-abortion president to date. [6]   Obama dedicated himself to promoting abortion—rather than reduce them as he promised.  Just to name a few of the administrative actions by which he has done this would include expanding abortions through  Obamacare , appointing many pro-abortion judges and officials, moving to strip medical professionals of rights of conscience, and forcing taxpayers to support the pro-abortion movement around the globe.

Despite framing himself as an advocate for the poor, speaking about against supposed income inequality, and supporting socialistic policies, Obama is a  limousine liberal , as his actions after his presidency testify.

Obama claims to have been born in  Honolulu, Hawaii  on August 4, 1961 to Stanley Ann Dunham and  Barack Obama Sr. —who had married just six months prior. [7]   Some contend that this story is a complete fabrication.  After many leading conservatives—including the leadership of this site and  Donald Trump —called for Obama to release his birth certificate, he produced a document that he claimed was his birth certificate on April 27, 2011.  Sheriff  Joe Arpaio  of Maricopa County in Arizona conducted an investigation of Obama's eligibility and questioned whether the alleged "birth certificate" was a fake; however, no charges were filed.   Obama  was reportedly assigned a social security number whose first three digits was assigned at that time to applications coming from zip codes in Connecticut. [8]

As an interesting side note, the Hawaii official (Loretta Fuddy, State Health Department Director) who verified Barack Obama’s birth certificate died in a plane crash. [9]  Besides Fuddy, Health Department Deputy Director Keith Yamamoto was also on board. The plane's engine had failed right after take off and crashed about a half-mile off Molokai's north shore on Dec 11, 2013 at about 4:00 p.m. Interestingly enough, Health Director Loretta Fuddy was the only death of the nine people on board; she died of "cardiac arrhythmia".

Claims that Obama was born in  Kenya  can be traced back to sources close to Obama. In 1991, Obama's literary agent, Acton & Dystel, published a promotional booklet that stated that Obama was born in Kenya. [10]  The claim that Obama was born in Kenya remained on the agent's web site until 2007. [11]  Internet archives confirm this information. [12]  In addition to the information from literary agents, Michelle Obama stated in a speech that Kenya is Obama's "homeland". [13]

Barack Obama Sr. was not a  citizen of the United States . At the time of Obama's birth, Kenya was a British colony, meaning that not only was Obama Sr. a British subject, but he passed that status on to his son. When Kenya gained independence, Obama and his father both ceased to be British subjects and became Kenyan citizens. Barack Obama was a dual citizen of the United States and Kenya until his Kenyan citizenship automatically expired in 1984, as he had failed to renounce US nationality and swear loyalty to Kenya. Even if he had been born with US citizenship through his mother, it has been argued that as he was born with dual nationality, he is not a natural-born citizen of the United States and thus constitutionally ineligible to become President.  Despite this, when courts considered such arguments, they found that Obama is a natural-born citizen. [14]

Obama's birth parents divorced in 1963 when his mother discovered Barack Obama Sr. was already married to a woman living in Kenya. [15]  When Obama was 2 years old his mother married Lolo Soetoro, an  Indonesian  geologist. At age 6 his mother and adoptive father took him to Jakarta, Indonesia for 4 years while his mother pursued a Ph.D. in Anthropology requiring fieldwork there. [16]  His mother then abandoned him in Hawaii with his grandparents (Stanley and Madelyn Dunham, who had moved to Hawaii in 1959)  [17]  so she could return to Indonesia after her divorce. Obama's grandfather arranged for his friend, the noted Communist writer  Frank Marshall Davis , to serve as a mentor and role model for an impressionable African-American youth.

Other siblings of Obama's include his half-sister Maya Soetoro-Ng and 7 other children born to his father by 4 different women. [18]  For much of his early life, prior to his transfer to  Columbia University , he went by his nickname, "Barry." In the summer of 1988, before attending  Harvard Law School  (he'd just been accepted), he visited Kogelo, Kenya, to learn more about his father's family. When his mother died in 1995, he and his sister Maya scattered her ashes over Hawaii's south shore. [17]

Obama attended  Reverend Jeremiah Wright 's Trinity United Church from 1984-1988 during his time as a  community organizer  ( See  1985-1988, Community Organizer  section ).  Obama credits Wright with his alleged conversion to Christianity, and had both his daughters, Sasha and Malia, baptized there. [17]

At age 6, Obama attended schools in Indonesia, the first a Catholic School while he was in Kindergarten, and later a public school. The school had mostly Muslim students (since most Indonesians are Muslim). In  Dreams from My Father , Obama writes, "In the Muslim school, the teacher wrote to my mother that I had made faces during  Koranic  studies." [19]   Insight  magazine first reported  Hillary Clinton 's organization had "questions about Obama’s Muslim background:  Are the American people ready for an elected president who was educated in a  Madrassa  as a young boy and has not been forthcoming about his Muslim heritage?" [20]

In 1971, at age 10, Barack Obama moved to Hawaii, and his grandparents helped him gain entrance to the prestigious Punahou Academy in Honolulu where he began substance abuse and illegal drugs. [21]  He was accepted through a scholarship for disadvantaged minorities while he was in 5th grade. [17]  At this elite high school with 1,200 students he was just 1 of 3 black students.  Obama failed to make the starting lineup of the school's state champion basketball team his senior year. He wrote a poem for the school's literary magazine,  Ka Wai Ola . [18]

In 1979, he began a 2-year stint at Occidental College college in Los Angeles, [7]  and then transferred to Columbia University in New York, which he graduated from in 1983. [22]  During this time he published an anti-military tirade embracing Soviet General Secretary  Leonid Brezhnev 's  [23]  proposal for a nuclear freeze in the campus newspaper and allegedly spoke at an Anti-Apartheid rally, [17]  although several prominent student leaders said they did not remember him there. Professor Michael L. Baron was impressed by Obama and wrote him a recommendation for Harvard Law School. [24]  From 1983 to 1988, Obama took time off from his education to work as a financial analyst and later a community organizer in Chicago. In the winter of 1988 Barack Obama decided to attend Harvard Law School, and left Chicago for Cambridge, Massachusetts. In his 2nd year a power struggle broke out among the dominant white liberals over control of the  Harvard  Law Review . Obama was elected its first black president as a compromise candidate largely with help of conservatives following a "marathon voting session" in which he finally won on the 19th ballot. [18]  This led to national attention and numerous job offers, which Obama passed up, at age 30, to pursue his political career in Chicago. [25]

When Obama was attending Harvard Law School, he dreamed of him or his children becoming like  Donald Trump . [26]

According to  Rising Star  by David J. Garrow, in 1986 Obama tried hard to convince Sheila Miyoshii Jager, someone of Dutch and Japanese ancestry, to marry him. [27]  She refused his request to marry him due to her age. By 1987, Obama had his sights on becoming U.S. President. [27]

Barack Obama met his spouse Michelle Robinson, while he was an intern and she was on staff at Sidley Austin LLP, a very large corporate law firm. [7]  Despite company policy prohibiting relations between staff and interns, the two became involved. The two continued a long-distance relationship while he finished law school, and on October 18, 1992, [28]  were joined in a domestic union officiated by Reverend  Jeremiah Wright  at Trinity United Church, [29]  a church which has supported gay marriage since the 1970s. [17]  Michelle has not practiced law since 1994 when she failed to renew her law license, allegedly to start a family. Malia, the couple's oldest daughter, was born in 1999, and Natasha (often called Sasha) in 2001. [7]

In 1984 Obama worked as a writer and financial analyst for Business International Corporation to help pay off some of his student loans. Business International Corporation was a small newsletter-publishing and research firm which aided multinational companies in understanding overseas markets. Obama served as a writer/researcher for a company reference service, Financing Foreign Operations, and wrote for their newsletter,  Business International Money Report . His supervisor was Cathy Lazere. [30]

In 1984, Obama was hired by the New York Public Interest Research Group, a non-profit organization promoting environmental, consumer, and government reforms. He also was paid just under $10,000 annually as a full-time organizer for Harlem's City College to mobilize student volunteers. [24]

From 1985-88, Obama worked as a community organizer on the South Side of Chicago  [31]  funded with a $25,000 grant by  Bill Ayers ' Woods Fund.  The New York Times  reported he was paid $1,000 a year, with $2,000 extra for a car [32]  however stories vary wildly. Jerry Kellman, who hired him, says it was "$10,000 a year and a $2,000 car allowance".  Obama himself gave different numbers; his memoir says $10,000 (as well as the car), in his Wesleyan speech he gave it as "$12,000 a year plus $2,000 for an old, beat-up car", and when he announced his candidacy for president, it was "a group of churches had offered me a job as a community organizer for $13,000 a year".

Ryan Lizza at  The New Republic  reported that "Jean Rudd of the Woods Fund...had provided Kellman with his original $25,000 to hire Obama".  Ari Berman reported in  The Nation  that the "[Woods Fund] gave a $25,000 grant to the Developing Communities Project, which hired Obama". CBS Channel 2 in Chicago ran a story with a document showing that Obama's proposed salary in 1987 was $25,000, a number that the Obama campaign confirmed while insisting at the same time his original salary was $13,000. [33]

During this time Obama joined Reverend Wright's Trinity United Church because in the words of Suzanne Malveaux of  CNN , "It was the church to join if you wanted to be one of Chicago's black movers and shakers." At the time, community organizing involved close affiliation with churches, which was how Obama met Wright. Obama abandoned the fight against asbestos contamination in the Altgeld Gardens housing project to pursue personal interests and a career by enrollment at Harvard Law School in the winter of 1988. [17]

In 1988 Obama gained work as a Summer Associate at one of the most prestigious corporate law firms in the world, Sidley Austin LLP, [34]  whose partners included  Newton Minow , thanks to the recommendation of Minow's daughter Martha, a professor at Harvard Law School. It was at the Sidley Austin firm that Obama would meet Michelle Robinson, his future domestic partner. [18]  From 1993-96 he practiced civil rights law including suing Citibank to force them into making  subprime mortgages  to minority borrowers. [35]   After graduating from Harvard he was hired by Miner, Barnhill, & Galland, a small politically-connected law firm. [36]   It was at Miner, Barnhill, & Galland that he would meet influential real estate developer  Tony Rezko . [17]

In 1991 Obama was recruited by Sandy Newman to head the Chicago chapter of Project Vote!, [17]  and in 1992 was the Executive Director, overseeing a voter registration drive which registered 125,000 black voters and was credited with defeating popular incumbent Democrat Senator Alan Dixon in the primary and electing  Carol Moseley-Braun  as a reprisal for Dixon's support for Supreme Court Justice  Clarence Thomas . [37]

According to the  Encyclopedia Britannica , prior to the information being scrubbed from its website in mid-April 2008 during the Democratic Presidential Primaries, Obama was one of three prominent organizers of black supremacist group the  Nation of Islam 's  Million Man March  on Washington, D.C. [38]

Obama taught part-time at the  University of Chicago  Law School [18]  from 1992-2004. Though Obama erroneously describes himself as a "constitutional law professor", [39]  he was actually only a senior lecturer and the class he taught the most times was called "Current Issues in Racism and the Law". [40]  He was a Lecturer from 1992–96, teaching 3 courses per year , and a senior lecturer from 1996-2004. After Obama was criticized for lying about his job title, the University of Chicago released a statement stating that senior lecturers are considered Law School faculty and regarded as professors but not full-time or tenured. Obama was invited to join the faculty in a full-time, tenured track position several times during this period but declined each time. [41]

In 1995 Obama published  Dreams From My Father  about his life and family background. [7]

On October 9, 2009 Barack H. Obama became the third sitting U.S. President [42]  to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize " for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples ". [43]  Obama stated that he was "surprised and deeply humbled" to receive the unexpected award, [44]  and also said, "To be honest, I do not feel that I deserve to be in the company of so many of the transformative figures who've been honored by this prize—men and women who have inspired me and inspired the entire world through their courageous pursuit of peace". [42]  The award was widely criticized given Obama's then lack of accomplishments. [45]

In 1995 a cadre of like minded individuals gathered for a fundraising event in the early career of Barack Obama hosted by  Weather Underground  (WUO)  terrorist   William "Bill" Ayers . Besides Obama, those in attendance were Ayers wife  Bernardine Dohrn , [46]  and Carl Davidson, veterans of  guerrilla warfare  training in  Cuba  just prior to the 1968 Democrat National Convention riots.  Ayers and Dohrn have taken credit for, and never denied, bombing the  U.S. Capitol , the  Pentagon  and the  State Department .

Ayers and Dohrn used their celebrity status among  leftists  to launch Obama's career. Ayers, Dohrn and  Jeff Jones [47]  are authors of  Prairie Fire: The Politics of Revolutionary Anti-imperialism , the title taken from  The Sayings of Mao Zedong . [48]  The book declares "we are  communist  men and women." [49]  Ayers later jokingly, publicly admitted to ghostwriting Obama's book,  Dreams From My Father [50]  and Obama was to appoint several openly avowed Maoists to prominent White House and Executive Branch positions. [51]

In a 2001 interview on WBEZ FM Chicago Public Radio, Senator Obama said some critically disparaging things about the  United States Constitution .  He said:

Barack Obama ran for the Illinois state senate in 1996. He was initially supported by incumbent  Alice Palmer , who declared she would run for the U.S. Congress. However, when her bid for Congress failed on November 28, 1995, she tried to run for her old seat in the March 1996 election. Her supporters asked Obama to step aside, although whether this was with her permission remains uncertain. [22]  Not only did Obama not step down, he gathered a team of high-priced lawyers, including fellow Harvard Law School graduate Thomas Johnson, to challenge his opponent's petition signatures on technicalities after the filing deadline had passed. Such tactics are legal and frequently used in Chicago; in 2006 they eliminated 67 of the 245 aldermanic candidates; [55]  yet nevertheless led to the term "hardball" by  The New York Times [22]  and "cutthroat" by David Mendel as reported by both CNN [17]  and MSNBC. [7]  The  Chicago Tribune  declared Obama had mastered "the bare-knuckle arts of Chicago electoral politics", noting "The man now running for president on a message of giving a voice to the voiceless first entered public office not by leveling the playing field, but by clearing it." [55]  As one of Obama's four opponents, eliminated through his ballot challenges, would put it:

—Gha-is Askia, 1996 Illinois Senate candidate [56]

In 2000, Obama lost his only political election when he chose to run against experienced incumbent and former  Black Panther  Bobby L. Rush for the U.S. Congress in a 65% black district. Rush's name recognition began at 90%, Obama's at 11%. Michelle Obama opposed taking on an such an iconic figure dear to the community and threatened divorce. [59]  Establishment Democrats considered Obama "a white man in blackface". [60]  Rush said of Obama, "He went to Harvard and became an educated fool," adding, "We’re not impressed with these folks with these eastern elite degrees." [61]  Todd Spivak would give voice to this impression of Obama, noting that

Rush would go on to win the Primary with 61.02% of the vote; Obama received 30.36%. [62]  The loss led to Obama considering dropping out of politics altogether, particularly after the September 11, 2001 attacks, since his name sounds similar to "Osama bin Laden". [7]

Obama entered the Illinois Senate promising change to a corrupt system. He mixed often radical votes with more pragmatic agreements. Possibly one of his most radical votes was against requiring medical care for aborted children who survive  the procedure  - in fact the Illinois Planned Parenthood Council ascribed him a 100% rating for his consistently pro-choice votes. [63]  He was criticized for using the statehouse as a stepping stone for a more illustrious career: Steven J. Rauschenberger, a  Republican , said prior to Obama's election as president: “He is a very bright but very ambitious person who has always had his eyes on the prize, and it wasn’t Springfield. If he deserves to be president, it is not because he was a great legislator.” [64]

The statehouse was majority Republican, so the Senator was sometimes forced to compromise. He formed allegiances across party lines to pass  campaign finance  reform that banned most gifts by lobbyists, prohibited spending campaign money for legislators’ personal use and required electronic filing of campaign disclosure reports. [64]  Obama also helped pass a so-called “driving-while-black bill”, which required the police to collect data on the race of drivers they stopped as a way to monitor  racial profiling . [64]

Obama established himself as a chief spokesperson in opposition to the  War on Terror  during an October 2002 rally at Federal Plaza in Chicago [65]   organized  by veteran  Maoist  and webmaster of  Progressives for Obama , [66]   Carl Davidson .

When Illinois' U.S. Senator Peter Fitzgerald announced he would be retiring in April 2003, Obama jumped at the opportunity, declaring that he would be a candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2004. [7]  To boost his chances Obama approached the newly crowned president of the Illinois Senate, Emil Jones Jr., with a proposal. According to Jones, whom Obama has since called his "godfather" [67]  the conversation went as follows:

Because of the deal, Obama's entire Illinois Senate legislative record was, as longtime Obama reporter Todd Spivak put it, built in a single year. During his 7th and final year in the Illinois Senate, Obama sponsored an incredible 26 bills into law, including many he now points to when criticized as inexperienced [57] —as CNN's Suzanne Malveaux observed, "With help from on high, Obama got his name on hundreds of bills that he pushed through." [17]  Jones not only had Obama craft legislation addressing daily tragedies to raise his political profile, [67]  he also appointed Obama head of almost all high-profile legislation in the Illinois Senate, angering other state legislators with more seniority who'd spent years supporting the bills. [57]  Illinois State Senator Rickey Hendon, the original sponsor of the famous racial profiling bill requiring videotaped confessions in police interrogations, complained bitterly about Jones' decision. [68]  Jones' influence had a major impact on Obama's chances in the 2004 elections, preventing major political players from backing Obama's opponents. To quote Emil Jones,

—Emil Jones [18]

Despite initially trailing in the polls to frontrunner  Blair Hull , [69]  Obama greatly benefited from what the  Chicago Tribune  called "the most inglorious campaign implosion in Illinois political history" [70]  when pressure from journalists and opposing candidates, just weeks before the election, forced the unsealing of Hull's messy divorce files. [71]  The files revealed Hull's ex-wife's accusations of verbal and physical abuse. [57]  Hull would afterwards criticize the media, stating, "As for the press, I will never read the newspaper the same way again." [70]  Obama would go on to win the Primary with 53% of the vote. [71]  Obama's unexpected victory led to him being termed a "rising star" by the media. [72]

Once again Obama found himself trailing to popular front runner  Jack Ryan , and once again a candidate's campaign imploded thanks to media intervention. In an unprecedented move, the  Chicago Tribune  and local TV station WLS sued to force the unsealing of Ryan's divorce files, despite opposition from both Ryan and his wife, Jeri Ryan, who in the files accused Jack Ryan of trying to coerce her to perform sex acts in public. Though Ryan advisors told him he could still win if using a negative attack on Obama, Ryan refused to engage in what he considered dirty politics. [73]  Ryan then dropped out of the race (per request by the Illinois GOP [74] ), following which the Illinois GOP scrambled to find a replacement, leaving Obama uncontested for weeks to campaign and build up public support. On top of all this, Obama was selected to give the keynote speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention (July 27 [75] ), catapulting him into the national spotlight, and leading to further media publicity terming him a "rising star". [76]

After a number of candidates including former  Chicago Bears  coach Mike Ditka declined to run, [77]  the Illinois GOP finally settled on fiery  Alan Keyes , a former Ambassador to the Economic and Social Counsel of the United Nations, [57]  with less than 3 months left before the November 2004 election. [7]  His sudden entrance into the state for the election was initially attacked in the press as "carpetbagging". [78]  Keyes repeatedly claimed his primary motivation for entering a race he had seemingly no chance of winning was his disgust at Obama's votes on the popular  Born Alive  bills. [79]  Keyes, from his first day of arriving in Illinois (August 9, 2004), [80]  accused Obama of having voted against bills mandating medical care for newborn children, and supporting "infanticide" (the term twice used in the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act [81] ) where hospitals left newborn infants to die like garbage. [82]  Obama in a debate on October 13, 2004, defended himself against Keyes' accusations of infanticide by claiming that Illinois law was already sufficient. [83]

However, Keyes' rhetoric, calling Obama's votes "the slaveholder's position" [80]  and saying "Jesus Christ would not vote for Obama" [84]  was widely ridiculed by the press. Keyes' unabashed criticism of homosexuality as "selfish hedonism" was also targeted. [85]  Obama would ultimately win the election, 70% to 27%. [86]

Obama's incomplete term in the U.S. Senate was largely not noteworthy. In voting against raising the  debt limit  in 2006 Obama famously said, "The fact that we are here today to debate raising America’s debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that the U.S. government can’t pay its own bills. ... I therefore intend to oppose the effort to increase America’s debt limit." [87]  In 2008 as candidate for president Obama called George W. Bush's request to raise the debt limit "irresponsible" and "unpatriotic". [88]

The  National Journal  ranked him the most liberal senator in 2007. [89]

Obama frequently used the  filibuster  to obstruct the operations of government, [90]  and voted against the  minimum wage  bill [91]  he introduced because it included a provision to pay active duty U.S. troops. He voted for the $700 billion TARP program to bailout the big banks after receiving more than $120,000 in contributions from  Fannie Mae , a government sponsored entity [92]  taken into conservatorship for mismanaging its affairs and responsible for all the big banks' problems.

According to Opensecrets.org, of the 671,269 contributions to Obama during his time in the Senate,  Goldman Sachs , JP Morgan, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley were among the top 20 biggest money donors to his campaigns. [93]  All four subsequently received approximately $70 billion in taxpayer assisted  bailout  money from the  TARP  program he voted for. [94]   UBS AG, a foreign bank and the 12th largest donor to Obama, [95]  was fined $780 billion in February 2009 in a U.S. Federal Court on charges it helped thousands of Americans evade taxes. [96]

Unlike Democrat contenders Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, Obama's hands were not "stained" with the Iraqi war resolution; a number of Democrats wanted to punish candidates for acting  bi-partisan  and called for his candidacy. His only career accomplishment til then had been the delivery of a speech at the 2004  Democratic National Convention .

Through heavy use of  early voting  by the Democrat political machine, Obama was elected president in 2008 in the midst of a severe economic meltdown and a foreign policy crisis. Obama outspent  John McCain  by hundreds of millions of dollars in 2008, [97]  and spending more than a billion dollars from special interests to snag reelection in 2012. [98]

Former  Democrat  Presidential candidate  Joe Lieberman  endorsed Obama's opponent  John McCain  in 2008 and declined to endorse Obama for the  2012 presidential election . [99]

In 2007-08, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton competed for the Democrat nomination. Hillary Clinton cleverly resurrected the "Born Alive" controversy surrounding Obama that had lain largely dormant since 2004 (notwithstanding the continuing mentions by  Jill Stanek ), by accusing Obama of not being pro-choice for voting "Present" on a number of abortion-related bills [100] —including the Born Alive ones, [101]  and cowardly ducking the votes. [102]  This led to criticism of Obama by two pro-choice organizations, Emily's List, and the  National Organization for Women . [103]  However, Pam Sutherland, the long-time head of Illinois Planned Parenthood, came to Obama's aid, criticizing Clinton for making the attack, and stating repeatedly that Obama's present votes were part of a broader strategy used by Planned Parenthood to keep Illinois voters from knowing their state senators were voting against the controversial and popular bills. [104] [105]

-Pam Sutherland, President/CEO of Illinois Planned Parenthood Council, 1980-2012 [106]

On June 30, 2008, Obama's voting record on the "Born Alive" bills came once more to the forefront when CNN gave voice to the growing controversy and revealed the defense Obama had been using since 2004-2008, that the Illinois bills he'd voted against were different from the federal bill, was false, since he'd brought up for a vote a bill word for word identical to the federal bill in the Health and Human Services Committee he chaired, and voted against it, defeating it. [118] [119]  This led in August to a confrontation between Obama and the  NRLC . [120]  After Obama accused critics of 'lying' [121]  the NRLC challenged the assertion, and the Obama campaign conceded he "misspoke" and had voted against an identical bill to the "federal bill that everybody supported" but focused on Obama's new claim, that Illinois law was already sufficient to protect newborn children. [122]  The NRLC promptly declared "Senator Barack Obama's four-year effort to cover up his full role in killing legislation to protect born-alive survivors of abortions continues to unravel." [123]

One major dilemma that arose for Obama during his campaign was his connection to his preacher  Jeremiah Wright . Obama and his wife (raised a Baptist) were members of the Trinity  United Church of Christ [124]  in Chicago, a church that embraced  black liberation theology  and its emphasis on empowering so-called "oppressed groups" against "establishment forces". This denomination was the first in America to ordain gays as ministers. [125]  Church pastor Jeremiah Wright had been making inflammatory comments and posting his sermons online for sale. These include the statement "G-d damn America," and in describing the September 11th attacks, "We have supported state terrorism against the Palestinians and black  South Africans , and now we are indignant because the stuff we have done overseas is now brought right back to our own front yards. America's chickens are coming home to roost." [126]  In addition, Rev. Wright blamed America saying "We supported Zionism shamelessly while ignoring the Palestinians and branding anybody who spoke out against it as being  anti-Semitic ."

In April 2008, after 20 years in the church, candidate Obama made public statements poised to set him at odds with the man who conducted his wedding and baptized his children. With the negative publicity persisting, a month later Obama ended the friendship, left Wright's church, and blamed the media. [127]   Obama claimed “It’s not fair to the other members of the church who seek to worship in peace...", and distanced himself from  Wright's sermons  as "a bunch of rants that aren't grounded in the truth." [128] [129]

Obama made an effort to portray John McCain as similar to George W. Bush, drawing attention to McCain's refusal to criticize the unpopular president. McCain was particularly criticized for saying of how many years we should be willing to stay in Iraq, "Make it a hundred." [130]

-Barack Obama [131]

On November 2, 2008, Barack Obama won the presidential election with 365 electoral votes to John McCain's 173. [134]  Obama received 53% of the popular vote to John McCain's 46%. [135]

The  liberal claptrap  that elected Obama seems silly today. It was claimed, for example, that Obama had millions of followers on Twitter, when allegedly some 70% of them were fake. [136]   And although the  lamestream media  promoted Obama as a great orator, in fact he relied almost entirely on teleprompters for his speeches and press conferences, and at one point even had teleprompters set up for him in a middle school classroom in order to speak to the media.

Five years into Obama's presidency the number of people holding jobs still was 3 million below the all-time high of 138 million [137]  workers - despite an increase of 10 million people in population over the same period of time. [138]  Under Obama and Senate Democrats [139]  budget management, the United States suffered its largest  deficits [140]  in history and its credit-worthiness downgraded from  Standard and Poor's . Obama assured Americans that unemployment would not rise above 8% if his  economic stimulus  program was adopted, however it rose and stagnated in the 8-10% range [141] [142]  for the entirety of his first term.

Patrick H. Caddell and Douglas E. Schoen, writing in the  Wall Street Journal , noted, "Rather than being a unifier, Mr. Obama has divided America on the basis of race, class and partisanship." The commentators also note Obama's approach to governance has encouraged radical leftists to pursue a similar strategy on his behalf. Mary Frances Berry, former head of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, acknowledged that the  Obama administration  has taken to polarizing America around the issue of race as a means of diverting attention from other issues, saying, "Having one's opponent  rebut charges of racism  is far better than discussing  joblessness ." [143]  Caddell and Schoen, who worked for President Carter and Clinton, respectively, further stated, "Mr. Obama has also cynically  divided the country on class lines . He has taken to playing the populist card time and time again. He bashes Wall Street and insurance companies whenever convenient to advance his programs, yet he has been eager to accept campaign contributions and negotiate with these very same banks and  corporations  behind closed doors in order to advance his political agenda... President Obama's divisive approach to governance has weakened us as a people and paralyzed our political culture." [144]

His economic  stimulus  package in response to the  Crash of 2008  took seven years to return  unemployment  to historically acceptable levels. Economic growth remained below 2.0% throughout his two terms as poverty and income inequality increased.

Critics of the Obama administration have coined the word " Obamunism " to describe Barack Obama's  socialistic  and " fascism  light"  economic planning  policies. [149] [150] [151]   Obamunism can also refer to Obama's  ruinous fiscal policies  and  reckless monetary policies . [152] [153] [154]   As seen in his own actions, Barack Obama instructed his advisors to find loopholes that would enable the president to act as a  dictator  by pushing through legislation and increases in spending without congressional authority. [155]

Nevertheless, budgets passed under President Obama have included the smallest average annualized growth of federal spending (1.4%) since before President Reagan. Federal spending grew an average of 8.7% per year during Reagan's first term and an average of 8.1% per year during George W. Bush's second term. [156]

Wall Street  firms and banks that were bailed out were among Obama's biggest campaign supporters. [157]   Therefore, the Obama administration bailouts of corrupt, unproductive, and reckless Wall Street firms was hardly surprising, and many argue that it was not helpful in making the United States economy more productive and prosperous by encouraging more risk taking through letting banks off with a slap on the wrist.  Others argue that bailing out the banks kept credit flowing and prevented a much deeper recession and a total collapse of the financial system.  The government will recoup some though not all of its capital infusions over time.  A 2005 study found that government corporate bailouts are often done for mere political considerations and the economic resources allocated exhibit significantly worse economic performance than resources allocated using purely business considerations. [158]   Proponents of  free market  capitalism said Bernanke should not have bailed out failing firms and instead should have allowed free market capitalism to quickly recover as it did in the depression of 1920 without government intervention (free market capitalists assert that government intervention drags out economic recessions and depressions). [159]

The Obama administration has been sharply criticized for  its massive deficit spending  and  its reckless monetary policy  via vast increases in the  money supply , although inflation under Bernanke has been below the historic mean. [152] [153] [160]  Celente predicts that if a "second American Revolution" occurs in a peaceful and productive manner, it may include a  third party movement  of governance that will advocate a more  free market   capitalism  approach to the American economy and a more strict interpretation of the  United States constitution  as far as the authors'  original intent .

During what the  White House  billed as  Recovery Summer , one half million workers per week continued losing their jobs. His signature legislative achievement,  ObamaCare ,has been found to be  unconstitutional [161]  by several judges and constitutional by others, and is credited as a major cause of uncertainty, high  unemployment , [162]  lagging job creation, [163]  and risk of a credit default crisis. [164] [165]

His 2012 Budget plan has been roundly criticized in the mainstream and liberal press as not a serious effort to deal with the nation's economic crisis. [166]

Jeffrey Tucker  wrote, "President Obama's economic policy has been catastrophic for liberty, enterprise, and the American dream—the very archetype of what not to do to end recession."  [167]

In early 2009, Obama lobbied Congress and the public to pass a sweeping Stimulus package [168]  known as  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009  (H.R. 1). [169]  The report of the Congressional Budget Office mandated by law stated that the legislation would ultimately harm the economy. [170]  Contrary to his promise of bipartisanship, [171]  the bill passed the House 244-188 on January 28, 2009 with 11 Democrats voting with the entire Republican caucus against, [172]  and received just 3 Republican votes when passing the Senate 61-37. [173]  One third of the massive $838 billion bill consisted of  backdoor tax expenditures [174]  and the rest direct  new spending  on "just about every pent-up Democratic proposal of the last 40 years." [175]  In responding to criticism of the broken bipartisanship promise at the time, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi famously quipped, "We won the election. We wrote the bill." [176]  On February 18, 2009, the Stimulus was signed into law by Obama. [177]  In August 2009, Republicans and Democratic Senator David Obey drew attention to mistakes on the Recovery.gov site claiming millions of Stimulus jobs created that didn't exist. Obama responded by saying the errors just indicate his accounting is an "inexact science". [178]

According to  Pulitzer Prize  winning journalist  Bob Woodward  of the  Washington Post , Obama misled the American people in a Presidential debate only two weeks before the 2012 election when he said, "The sequester is not something that I’ve proposed,” [179]   when in fact his chief budget negotiator and current Chief of Staff,  Jack Lew , made a call to Democrat  Harry Reid  at 2:30 pm on July 27, 2011 with the proposal after clearing it with Obama, [180]  as fully documented in Woodward's book,  The Price of Politics . Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben Bernanke  warned of immediate jobloss of about 750,000 jobs - about the same level as under George W. Bush [181]  - if Obama's budget and economic plans were allowed to take effect. [182]

Woodward, who's reporting on  Watergate  is credited with toppling the administration of  Richard Nixon , told Wolf Blitzer of CNN he was told by a senior White House official he'd regret talking about the President Obama's positions on the sequester. [183]

Following the 2011 debt ceiling standoff between Obama and House Republicans, [184]  the United States Government's credit rating was, for the first time in its history, downgraded from AAA to AA+, and  poverty [185]  increased markedly. By and large his programs, said to combat the recession, unemployment, slow growth, and deficits, have failed [186]  leaving the country saddled with an $18 trillion  national debt  and climbing. [187]  One of his most well known tactics is blaming someone else, such as George W. Bush, for all his failures instead of taking responsibility. Also on the domestic front, Obama passed an expensive  health care  bill in 2010 with no national consensus or  bipartisan  support and 34 Democrats dissenting. Recently, the  Congressional Budget Office  wrote an open letter to  John Boehner , the Speaker of the House, outlining the effects of repealing  Obamacare  and explaining why net loss of over 100 billion dollars would occur from the repeal. [188]

On March 23, 2010, Obama signed the unpopular Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). The act originated in the Democrat-controlled House and was amended and passed the Senate just prior to Sen.  Ted Kennedy 's death largely along party lines with a significant number of Democrats voting to oppose. In what was construed as a de facto rejection of the bill,  Massachusetts  voters elected a  Republican  candidate,  Scott Brown , who promised to vote against the bill if given the chance. [189]   After Obama made a promise to issue an  executive order  that would ultimately prohibit the use of taxpayer subsidies to pay for  abortion  services, [190]  the Democratic  House of Representatives  would pass the bill as it left the Senate 219-212, with 34 Democrats and all other parties dissenting. [191]

Amongst other things, the act mandated that everyone purchase health care coverage or face punitive tax measures, and was upheld by the  Supreme Court .

Obama criticized the "revolving door" of government and business. [192]  After appointing  Peter Orszag  his first Budget Director to dole out the stimulus cash, Orszag resigned to become Citigroup's Vice Chairman of Global Banking. Citigroup was the recipient of $476 billion in  bailout  money - more than any other bank - after the disastrous  Financial crisis of 2008 . [193]  Before the bailout, Orszag's expert opinion of the chances of a mortgage meltdown were 1 in 500,000. [194]

President Obama authorized offshore oil drilling in the  Gulf of Mexico [195]  stating, "oil rigs today generally don’t cause spills" [196]  and was widely criticized for his mishandling of the " worst environmental disaster  in US history." [197] [198]

Candidate Obama promised to repeal a policy that originated with President Clinton and passed by a Democrat-controlled Congress that prohibited inquiries into military personnel's  sexual orientation  while barring openly gay  homosexuals  from serving in the military.  Liberals  expressed anger when time passed and no effort to repeal the law was seen; [199]  in fact, Obama's  justice department , as part of their duty to defend all laws passed by any administration, filed a brief arguing against the  Supreme Court  granting a  writ of certiorari  to a gay soldier challenging the law (the writ was not granted). In response, the soldier, James Pietrangelo II, a former Army infantryman and lawyer, said, “(Obama's) a coward, a bigot and a pathological liar. This is a guy who spent more time picking out his dog, Bo, and playing with him on the White House lawn than he has working for equality for gay people." [200]

On December 15, 2010, a bill was introduced in the  House of Representatives  to repeal the law - it passed a day later by a vote of 250-175; [201]  it passed the Senate three days later 65-31. [202]  Obama signed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010 on December 22. [203]  The  Pentagon  itself could not immediately implement the repeal and questioned whether it would hurt combat readiness. [203]

Obama's first act of office was to sign the  Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act  - effectively nullifying the  Supreme Court  case  Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. , which ruled that Ledbetter had to have filed a pay  discrimination  suit within 180 days of the first time Ledbetter was paid less than her male peers; [204]  the law made corporations subject to suit within 180 days of each time the employee was unfairly paid. [205]

On January 2, 2011, Obama signed the James Zadroga  9/11  Healthcare and Compensation Act. [206]  The act, which afforded 9/11 first responders who were sickened by the dust from the collapse of the  World Trade Center  health care and compensation, passed  Congress  after its sponsors agreed to scale down the pricing from 7.4 to 4.2 billion dollars. [207]

When first running for office Obama angered religious conservatives with his comment about working-class voters in old industrial towns. Obama said, "They get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations." [209]

The Obama administration has been widely criticized for his policies which encroach on religious freedom in areas such as: health care, freedom to dissent on matters relating to the  homosexual agenda , religious freedom in the military and religious freedom in other spheres of American life. [210]

In addition, the Obama administration has been criticized for promoting religious freedom for  Muslims  and restricting religious freedom for Christians. [211]

See also:   Atheism and American politics

The Obama administration became the first administration to met with an  atheist  group. It met with the Secular Coalition for America which is a coalition which represents the  American Atheists , the American  Humanist  Association, and the Military Association of Atheists and  Freethinkers .

According to the  USA Today , the group met with the White House officials to "discuss problems that they believe are fueled by religion." [212]   Among the issues the group discussed were the issues of "military proselytizing" by  evangelical  Christian members of the military and faith-based initiatives [212]

The Obama Administration was weak on  illegal immigration . It established the  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  program (DACA) [213]  in 2012, which gave protection to illegal immigrants to came to the U.S. as children. Additionally, it was reported the administration let 2.2 million deportable illegal immigrants, including 400,000 with criminal convictions, remain on the streets. [214]  He nearly doubled the number of illegal immigrant juveniles with the EB-4 visa, which gave them legal status. [215]  The Obama Administration issued 140,000 U visas, which are given to illegal immigrants who testify against criminals in court and allow them to eventually gain citizenship, massively expanding the program. [216]

In 2015, President Obama signed an executive order that would have expanded protections from deportation to a total of about 5 million illegal immigrants. This order was blocked by a federal judge, [217]  upheld by an appeals court, [218]  and a split 4–4 Supreme Court ruling upheld the appeals court ruling. [219]

Under President Obama,  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  released 564 convicted sex offender illegal immigrants, in many cases because various countries refused to accept them back. [220]  In May 2017, a whistleblower revealed that the Obama Administration knowingly let illegal immigrant  MS-13  gang members into the country. [221] [222]

After assuming office in 2017, the  Trump Administration  made  a large change in its policies  towards illegal immigration compared to the Obama Administration. [223]  Secretary of Homeland Security  John Kelly  of the Trump Administration strongly criticized the Obama Administration for its failures regarding illegal immigration and national security. [224] [225]

Unlike Presidents  Abraham Lincoln  and  Franklin Roosevelt , Barack Obama has shown scant concern about the revival of  slavery  which took place on his watch shortly after his "apology tour", intended to diminish U.S. influence in the world. [226] [227]  Obama, who was raised a Muslim [228] [229]  and is not a descendent of slaves, criticized Christians and the Crusades as reports of thousands of women and girls being captured, sold, and raped flooded in. [230] [231]

The number of jihadis worldwide has grown by a factor of 4 or 5 at least, since Obama took the reins of power as Commander-in-Chief. [232]  Remarkably, the  New York Times  was critical of Obama's incessant boasting about the killing of  bin Laden . [233]   With the complete disengagement of American troops from  Iraq  and the assassination of  Osama bin Laden , the  Islamic State  arose and recruitment of global  jihadis  multiplied exponentially.

Obama entered his second term mocking and ridiculing the idea that Russia was America's prime geo-strategic competitor; by the closing days of his presidency, Obama was in a panic fanning the flames of a Third Red Scare. Vladimar Putin and Russia had thoroughly embarrassed Barack Obama on the world stage as Obama withdrew America from its traditional role of global leadership and reputiated the idea of  American exceptionalism . Respect for America degenerated in the world as issues such as transexual bathrooms occupied more of Obama's time and attention then the 12 million homeless refugees Obama had driven from their homes in his failed " Arab Spring " policy. Having been thoroughly rebuked politically with the election of Donald Trump, as a  lameduck  Obama attempted to coverup  DNC  scandals uncovered by  Wikileaks  by scapegoating Vladimar Putin and fostering an atmosphere of paranoia about Russia, the future, and a Trump presidency.

As Senator, Obama was highly critical of President Bush and promised change. As President, Obama has tripled down in Afghanistan, widened the war into Pakistan, multiplied drone attacks, bombed Yemen and Somalia, and started an undeclared NATO war in Libya. On presidential war powers, surveillance questions, Guantanamo, detention policy and habeas corpus, Obama has similarly stayed the course, or expanded Bush's precedents. In a speech on May 19, 2011 Obama fully embraced the  Bush Doctrine  of preventative war. [234] 
From the Boston Globe:

'The New America Foundation, which tracks the strikes, has listed 23 raids since the beginning of April, 2011, all but one in Pakistan’s tribal regions of North and South Waziristan. A June 20 attack was reported in Kurram, an area north of North Waziristan along the Afghanistan border.'

'The drone program has become increasingly controversial as the Obama administration has expanded its use beyond the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. Lethal missiles have been launched from unmanned aircraft in at least five countries in addition to Pakistan: Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Yemen, and, most recently, Somalia. The military’s Joint Special Operations Command used a drone last June to attack what officials said were two senior members of the Al Shabab militant group on the Somali coast.'   [235]

A commentator says:

'Obama is commendable when he says he wants to avoid war. His policies, however, favor war by destabilizing the Middle East making it extremely hostile and favoring radical Islam over America’s ally, Israel, and American interests in the region... The president has chosen a very dangerous path for every American and one that promises great difficulty for Israel.'  [236]

By Obama's third year as Commander-in-Chief, over 1200 American troops died in Iraq and Afghanistan - significantly more than the number who died during President  George W. Bush 's term of office.  And growing numbers of civilian contractors also have fallen. In the first half of 2010, 250 contractors reportedly died in Iraq and Afghanistan - more than the 235 military personnel who fell during the same period. [237]

President Obama signed into U.S. law the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), only after his administration successfully lobbied to remove language from the bill that would have protected American citizens from being detained indefinitely without trial. [238]  After the legislation cleared Congress, the ACLU commented that if President Obama signed the bill it "will damage both his legacy and American’s reputation for upholding the rule of law," while executive director of the  Human Rights Watch  blasted the President for being ‘on the wrong side of history,’ noting that "Obama will go down in history as the president who enshrined indefinite detention without trial in US law." [239] [240]

Section 1031 of the NDAA bill, which itself defines the entirety of the United States as a “battlefield,” allows American citizens to be snatched from the streets, carted off to a foreign detention camp and held indefinitely without trial. As reported by Infowars.com, the bill states that “any person who has committed a belligerent act” faces indefinite detention, but no trial or evidence has to be presented, the White House merely needs to make the accusation. [241] [242] [243]

American deaths in  Afghanistan  more than doubled in Obama's first few years compared with the preceding eight years of George Bush  [244]  as he increased troop strength for no discernible purpose and to "win" unstated objectives.  Against his own Defense Secretary's advice, Obama  attacked Libya  and forced regime change without Congressional authorization in violation of the post-Nixon era reform measure, the  War Powers Act .

After he took personal credit for killing  Osama bin Laden , the  U.S. State Department  warned of increased risk to the lives and safety of Americans. [245]  Bin Laden's successor,  Ayman al-Zawahiri  confirmed the  Benghazi Attack  which took place on the anniversary of 9/11 and killed more Americans, was motivated by al-Qaeda's desire for revenge. [246]  Bin Laden's death, as Obama's advisers warned, freed up jihadis who swore an oath of allegiance to the 9/11 mastermind to swear allegiance to rival and competing factions. The competing factions advocated the immediate establishment of the Islamic State, rather than after the overthrow of the Saudi monarchy and retaking of Mecca. As was well known, bin Laden always held a controversial and minority position among jihadis on the strategy for global jihad by attacking the United States first.  Bin Laden's killing, intended as an election year gimmick, brought Obama no improvement in approval ratings and spawned unprecedented growth in global terror and jihadi recruiting.

Obama needlessly escalated troop strength [247]  and defense costs in Afghanistan from $43.5 billion in George Bush's last year to $113.7 billion for 2011. [248]  Adviser to General  Stanley McChrystal  David Kilcullen wrote, "One of the big strategic shifts is the use of language now which talks about Pakistan and Afghanistan as the same theater. Now we talked about Af-Pak long before the Obama administration came about, but the public use of that term, and the description of it as the Afghanistan-Pakistan campaign, sends a new message to people about how the administration is going to think about Afghanistan and Pakistan." [247]

In February 2011, the political unrest that spread through the Arab world showed up as protests in Libya. Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, leader of Libya for 41 years, responded to the violence [249]  with legitimate steps. [250]  The  United Nations Security Council  voted to impose  sanctions , and later passed a resolution to protect civilians. Obama, without approval from Congress and over the objections of his own National Security staff, [251]  directed American forces to take out Libya's air defense system. [250]  Secretary of Defence  Robert Gates , National Security Adviser Tom Donilon, Deputy National Security Adviser Denis McDonough, and  White House  counterterrorism chief  John O. Brennan  all opposed the action. Obama later said, "if we waited one more day Benghazi, a city nearly the size of Charlotte, could suffer a massacre that would have reverberated across the region and stained the conscience of the world." [252]   Alan J. Kuperman , in an editorial for the  Boston Globe , suggested this statement was false, writing, "intervention did not prevent genocide, because no such bloodbath was in the offing. To the contrary, by emboldening rebellion, US interference has prolonged Libya’s civil war and the resultant suffering of innocents." [253]  Kuperman, a professor of public affairs at the  University of Texas  who authored a book called  The Limits of Humanitarian Intervention , further stated that the rebels had tricked the world into thinking a bloodbath was at hand and that Obama had lied to the American people in order to act on this theory. [253]

Gaddafi [never] threaten[ed] civilian massacre in Benghazi, as Obama alleged. The “no mercy’’ warning, of March 17, targeted rebels only, as reported by  The New York Times , which noted that Libya’s leader promised amnesty for those “who throw their weapons away.’’ Gaddafi even offered the rebels an escape route and open border to Egypt, to avoid a fight “to the bitter end.’’  [254]

Gaddafi wrote to Obama and told him he bore no ill will. "We have been hurt more morally than physically because of what had happened against us in both deeds and words by you," he wrote. "Despite all this you will always remain our son whatever happened. We still pray that you continue to be president of the USA. We endeavour and hope that you will gain victory in the new election campaign." [255]

A March 29, 2011 article in the  Washington Post  included these paragraphs:

This set off a fierce debate in the  Obama administration  over the wisdom of arming terrorists. [257]  It is now known sometime prior to March 31, 2011, [258]  at the urging of Hillary Clinton [259]  and over the objections of his National Security Council, Obama signed a Presidential Finding authorizing support for the rebel jihadis. [260]

By October 2011,  Libyan rebel fighting groups  with support from  NATO  overtook the capital and toppled the government. Gaddafi was captured and brutally and sadistically murdered. [261]  The jihadis were immediately recognized by the U.S. and the U.N. as the new legitimate government. Mustafa Abdul-Jalil, chairman of the National Transitional Council, announced  Sharia  will be the source for all legislation and all laws conflicting with Sharia are null and void. [262]  Abdel Rahim al-Kib, the country's interim prime minister, echoed Jalil's words days later. [263]  The al Qaeda flag was flown above the Benghazi courthouse, and reports surfaced that the Libyan jihadis had imposed Sharia law in some parts of the country even earlier. [262]  By February 17, 2013, four foreign nationals were arrested for distributing Christian literature, a charge that could carry the death penalty. [264]

With several U.S. embassies besieged on the anniversary of the  September 11 attacks , White House Press Secretary  Jay Carney  declared there was no reason to believe the attack on the sovereign territory of the United States consulate in Benghazi, less than two months before the  2012 Presidential election  which killed Americans, was a terrorist attack.

This became the official White House line. Between laughs with  Jon Stewart  on  Comedy Central , Obama said the death of Americans was "not optimal". [265]  When pressed by reporters, who pointed out evidence that the violence in Benghazi was a terrorist attack, Press Secretary Carney argued “the unrest around the region has been in response to this video.”

Leading suspected jihadis in the murders and terrorist attack were the local Benghazi branch of Ansar al-Shariah, known to have ties to al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. [266]  A commander of the terrorist group boasted jovially about the attack over drinks with reporters for the  New York Times  in Benghazi. [267] [268]

Two more Americans were killed, along with 35 others, after being taken hostage by rebel jihadists in Mali shortly after the Libyan upheaval. [269]

Hillary Clinton testified before the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the wake of the Benghazi murders  under her stewardship, that weapons and fighters equipped by the Obama administration made their way to  Mali  and  Algeria :

In 2012, during the  Syrian Civil War , President Obama stated that if the Syrian dictator, President  Bashar al-Assad  used  chemical weapons  against Syrians, that would be unacceptable and cross a red line. However, after it was confirmed that Assad did use weapons against his people, Obama did practically nothing. He went to Congress to authorize a military strike, but this request was rejected (he had the ability to order a military strike without Congress's approval). Later, the Obama Administration (particularly  Susan Rice ) [271]  and the mainstream media [272]  claimed they had worked with Syria to remove its chemical weapons. In April 2017, Syria again used chemical weapons against its people, proving their claim wrong. [271]  The new president,  Donald Trump , unlike Obama, quickly ordered a large airstrike against a Syrian airbase. [273]

Before Obama's Fast and Furious operation was exposed, the number of dead victims in drug cartel violence has been estimated as high as 160,000 deaths.

The  Washington Post  reported that White House officials stopped a requirement for gun dealers to report bulk sales of high-powered semiautomatic rifles commonly used by illegal drug cartels.   Justice Department  officials had asked for White House approval to require thousands of gun dealers along the border to report the purchases to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms and Explosives. ATF investigators expected to get leads on suspected arms traffickers. Senior law enforcement sources said the proposal from the ATF was held up by then White House chief of staff  Rahm Emanuel . [276]  Gun dealers had been required for decades to report the sales of multiple handguns to the ATF.

During his presidency, Obama instituted a major détente with the oppressive Communist dictatorship of  Cuba , despite its failed leftist governance and human rights violations. [277] [278]  In August 2015, the U.S. and Cuba reopened each other's embassies. [279] [280]  In September 2016, Obama nominated the first U.S. Ambassador to Cuba in 55 years. [281]  Obama did everything in his power to normalize relations with the failed dictatorship, but the U.S. embargo against Cuba remained in place due to opposition from the Republican-controlled Congress. [282]

Despite Obama's support for mass immigration and amnesty for those who immigrated illegally, he ended the "wet foot, dry foot" policy that allowed Cuban refugees to legally stay in the U.S. [283]

One of Obama's campaign promises was that he would close the American detention center at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba - detainees would be flown to other countries while the ones awaiting trial would enter the American court system. Two days after taking office he signed an order directing the military to do so. [284]  But, in November 2009 Obama admitted that his self-imposed deadline of January 2010 would be missed, and in March 2011 the president went back on his campaign promise, signing an executive order to create a formal system of indefinite detention for the prisoners. [284]

Obama ultimately failed to close Guantanamo Bay, although he continually attempted to reduce the number of detained terrorists held at the base, even in the last days of his presidency. [285] [286]

Obama criticized president of  Russia ,  Vladimir Putin  for carrying out a referendum for the seizure of  Crimea  to Russia. [287]

Obama has had very poor relations with the conservative  Israel I Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu . During the very tight and closely-watched 2015 elections, the Obama Administration attempted to influence the election—in order to elect a leftist government in the nation and defeat Netanyahu—by financing a liberal Israeli political organization. [288]  Netanyahu decisively won the election, despite opposition from left-wing world leaders such as Obama. [289]

On December 23, 2016, Obama broke over 35 years of American policy by abstaining from a UN vote and allowing a blatantly anti-Israel resolution to pass, showing his true anti-Israel stance. [290] [291]  On December 28, 2016, just a few weeks before the  Trump Administration  was to take office and a few days after the anti- Israel  resolution was adopted, Kerry gave a major 72-minute [292]  speech viciously attacking Israel and paying worthless lip-service to American "support" for the nation. [293]  Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  responded harshly but appropriately to the Administration's blatant betrayal. [294]

Despite these actions, the U.S. House passed a motion on January 5, 2017 condemning Obama's allowing of the UN resolution. [295] [296]  Additionally, Republican President-elect  Donald Trump  voiced strong support for Israel during this time. [297] [298]

Soon before leaving office, Obama bypassed Congress and gave the  State of Palestine  $221 million. [299]

Preferring international cooperation and equality (despite the U.S.'s obviously superior geopolitical position) to American sovereignty and independence, Obama intentionally reduced American power and strength during his presidency. One of his actions as president was to give up the nation's control of  internet domain name system  and transfer control over to an international organization in 2016. [300] [301]

Obama has maintained tense relations with Congress throughout his term as President.  Each of his budgets have been voted down, and many of his judicial appointments have not come to a vote.  When Supreme Court Justice  Antonin Scalia  died on February 13, 2016, Obama made a point of addressing the nation to say that he would nominate a replacement, which drew criticism and rebuke from Republican Senators and Presidential candidates.  Obama executive action in areas such as immigration policy have drawn extensive criticism as infringing upon Congressional legislative powers.

By custom, President Obama stayed neutral during the primaries, eventhough his close friend and Vice President  Joe Biden  was seriously considering a Presidential campaign.

Once Hillary Clinton won the Democratic nomination, Obama campaigned for her and also attended fundraisers.  Obama publicly criticized the Republican candidate,  Donald Trump  who had previously spent years claiming that Obama was not born in the United States.

On March 4, 2017, after becoming President, Trump tweeted:

and

Members of the mainstream media called this wiretapping claim an "astonishing and reckless accusation". [303]  Obama and his director of national intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. as well as the head of the FBI have denied that this happened. [303]   In turn, Trump has called for a Congressional investigation of the alleged wiretapping. [304]

In a stunning repudiation of Obama's policies, Republican businessman  Donald Trump  was elected over Democrat  Hillary Clinton . In a frantic attempt to leave some sort of legacy, Obama issued a very large amount of far-Left executive orders and regulations which revealed his true political views if any doubt remained. [305]  These orders included blocking large areas of the  Arctic  and  Atlantic  oceans from oil and gas drilling, effectively barring the U.S. from real  energy independence ; breaking the record of pardons and commutations in a single day for criminals (many of them were sentenced for drug-related crimes), showing his soft stance on crime and drugs; ending the defunct NSEERS program to register male immigrants from North Korea and  Islamic  countries (the necessary, beneficial, and useful program was suspended by the Obama Administration in 2011 [306] ); attempting to transfer even more terrorists out of  Guantanamo Bay ; allowing an anti- Israel  resolution pass in the  United Nations ; enacting a record amount of unnecessary, useless, and job-killing regulations; and even more. [305]  Obama added 120,000 illegal immigrants to the DACA program in the last three months of his presidency. [307]  Obama made these actions knowing that Trump, who had almost completely opposite political views on these issues, was going to enter the  White House  in such short a time.

Although all of Obama's actions were worrisome, his actions in regards to Israel were particularly noteworthy. He broke over 35 years of American policy by abstaining from a UN vote and allowing a blatantly anti-Israel resolution to pass, showing his true stance concerning Israel. [290] [291]  Soon before leaving office, Obama bypassed Congress and gave the  State of Palestine  $221 million. [299]

Obama continued to believe that he could have successfully "won" a third term as president had he been able to run. [308]  Regardless of the factuality of that claim, Democrats lost 1,042 seats—including U.S. House, Senate, state governorship, and state legislative seats—during his eight years in office. [309]  Obama also believed that "the Democratic Party has stayed pretty grounded in fact and reality" despite its negative policies that suggest otherwise. [310]

Obama made Trump's transition much harder and rockier than it could have been by his leftist executive orders, decisions, and comments during the transition period. [311] [312]

Obama received the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service from  Secretary of Defense   Ash Carter , an Obama appointee in the same administration. [313]  Although the award was created in 1947, the only other presidents to have received the medal (all during their tenure) are  Bill Clinton , a left-wing Democrat, and  George W. Bush , who holds  RINO  positions on certain issues.

In an interview, Obama claimed that "we are probably the first administration in modern history that hasn't had a major scandal in the White House," [314]  and Obama's Chief of Staff  Denis McDonough  claimed likewise, [315]  despite the strong and massive evidence to the contrary. [316] [317]

In addition to his other actions in 2016, Obama massively increased the number of federal regulations during his last days in office. [318] [319]  More regulations were finalized in every year since 2005, and they cost the economy $2 trillion. [320]

During his campaigns Obama said that he intended to " spread the wealth around " and was portrayed as saying that entrepreneurs and employers deserve no credit for building their businesses. [321]  On March 1, 2013 Obama issued  executive orders  to implement his  sequester  of budget cuts which [322]  has been widely criticized for destroying jobs in what was an anemic and fragile recovery. [323]

Warren L. Dean Jr., an adjunct professor of law at  Georgetown University  Law Center, wrote:

According to a  NBC News  poll, from August 2014, Obama's approval rating was a dismal 40%, [325]  showing that six in ten Americans disapproved of his  liberal  policies. Given that liberals frequently engage in  deceit , the actual approval ratings could be much lower. When Obama left office, the same pollsters who prognosticated a blowout win for Hillary Clinton maintained Obama's approval rating was above 50%.

On April 27, 2011, [326]  a long-running controversy surrounding Obama's birth was largely put to rest [327]  when Obama had his long-form birth certificate posted at WhiteHouse.gov. [328]   Donald Trump , who had been critical of Obama for allowing the divisiveness to linger was then leading Republicans in polls for the upcoming GOP primary [329]  and has been credited with bringing final resolution to the issue. The birth certificates of Michelle Robinson, which would disclosure her birth-sex, and the two children which would clarify their birth parentage however, remain undisclosed.

The following is a synopsis of previous events leading up to the release:

Hillary Clinton top advisor  Sidney Blumenthal , and his son, Max Blumenthal, were the origin of the rumors in 2008 that Barack Hussein Obama was a Muslim in order to stir up fear among white Democrats and women, intended for Hillary's benefit. [330]  McClatchy Washington Bureau Chief James Asher relayed, "Mr. Blumenthal and I met together in my office and he strongly urged me to investigate the exact place of President Obama’s birth, which he suggested was in Kenya." [331]  Snope's has identified a claim that a 1991 promotional booklet by Barack Obama's then-literary agency, Acton & Dystel, touted Obama as "born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii" as being true. [332]

Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign  team then began spreading  Islamophobic  rumors that Obama was a  Muslim  schooled in a  madrassa  as a child in Indonesia. [333] [334]  A group registered as People United Means Action (PUMA) was made up of Hillary Clinton supporters who not only opposed Barack Obama's nomination but also sought to delegitimitize his presidency. [335]  PUMA members charged that the media directed  sexism  and  misogyny  at Clinton during the 2008 primary campaign and expressed anger at  Democratic Party  leaders' failure to speak out or otherwise respond appropriately.

Hillary Clinton had received a majority of votes in the 2008 Democratic primaries and PUMA felt the  Superdelegates  robbed Hillary of the nomination.

Obama transformed the Bush administration War on Terror from a preventative measure against terrorism to a cry for vengeance, mob bloodlust, and retribution killings which spawned a fresh, new, and larger cycle of violence.

On May 1, 2011, Obama misled the public when he announced  [336] [337]  that Osama bin Laden was "killed in a firefight" after a U.S. special operations group infiltrated a compound in  Abottobad , Pakistan. [338]  Attacks, murders, and kidnappings of Americans have since escalated as reprisals for bin Laden's death.  Al Qaeda , once broken and on the run, operates openly as the jihad has now become global. Relations with Pakistan, a longtime ally throughout the Cold War and War on Terror, became strained. The government of Pakistan denied White House claims it allowed Americans to kill Muslims on its territory. [339]  For all his duplicity and criticism of the War on Terror, Obama experienced only a temporary blip in approval ratings. [340] [341]

An NBC investigation revealed Obama was informed of bin Laden's whereabouts one full year before he attempted to use it as an election year issue. NBC further reported that there was no "firefight" at all, contradicting what the president told the nation. [342]  As early as the day after bin Laden was executed, it was learned bin Laden was not armed in the alleged "firefight" that Obama claimed took place.

After the  Benghazi terrorist attack  which his administration knowingly and fraudulently blamed on the creator of an irreverent YouTube video critical of the founder of Islam, Obama made a speech at the UN in which he said,

Four Americans died in the terrorist action intended to commemorate the  9/11 attacks . The attack occurred on the US Consulate at Benghazi, part of the territory of the United States. Administration officials did nothing to repel the attack in progress while huddling to discuss the domestic political ramifications for the upcoming presidential election, less than two months away. The creator of the video was jailed on bogus charges unrelated to the video. In 2015, a series of terrorist attacks in France, Denmark and the United States claimed the lives of at least 15 people with dozens injured, including security and police officers, motivated by Muslim extremists defending what, in their view were, unflattering depictions of the founder of Islam,  Mohammad .

According to Stanley Kurtz - author of  Radical-in-Chief: Barack Obama and the Untold Story of American Socialism  (2010) Obama in 1995 sought and obtained the endorsement of a left-wing third party, the  New Party  in his quest to be elected to the Illinois State Senate. [344]  Obama's "Fight the Smears" campaign has denied this, as has  Politico 's Ben Smith. [345]  Others who claim he was affiliated with the New Party/ACORN include  The Blaze 's Billy Hallowell, [346]   Breitbart 's Joel Pollack,  Human Events ' Erick Erickson, [347]  Newsbusters' P.J. Gladnick, [348]  Rick Moran at AmericanThinker.com, [349]  and various writers at  Discover the Networks  (which include Kurtz and Erickson). [350]

Kurtz in 2012 has claimed to find minutes of the New Party Chicago chapter that say, " Barack Obama, candidate for State Senate in the 13th Legislative District, gave a statement to the membership and answered questions. He signed the New Party 'Candidate Contract' and requested an endorsement from the New Party. He also joined the New Party. " [345]  Obama campaign strategist David Axelrod responded to Kurtz with silence and when asked if that meant "yes or no", Axelrod stated, "You can take that as I have no idea what you are talking about." [351]

For a more detailed treatment, see  You didn't build that . 
On July 13, 2012, at a campaign event in  Virginia , Obama gave a speech that immediately stirred up controversy. Speaking about the government's role in the success of private business, he said: [352]

On November 6, 2012 Barack Obama won reelection with 332 electoral votes to Mitt Romney's 206. [353]  Obama received 51% of the popular vote (65,899,660 votes) to Romney's 47% (60,932,152 votes). [354]

Obama made an ungraceful departure from office claiming on October 18, 2016 Donald Trump's complaints of lies spread about Trump were corrosive to American democracy and an invented conspiracy theory. [355]  Less than two months later after Trump had won, Obama claimed he himself had been derelict in his duty and had fallen asleep at the switch allowing Russian hackers to steal the election for Donald Trump. [356]

Despite Obama's opposition to Trump's plan to build a wall along the U.S.- Mexico  border in order to secure it, it was reported in early 2017 that he was building a wall around his new mansion, obviously in order to keep unwanted people out. [357]

After the end of his presidency, Obama spent much of his time vacationing in exclusive and elite locations around the world. [358]  He spent much time with left-wing celebrities, such as spending  Good Friday  2017 on a $300 million yacht with celebrities such as  Bruce Springsteen ,  Tom Hanks , and  Oprah Winfrey . [359]  In addition, Obama accepted a $400,000 speech backed by Wall Street, [360]  something that stunned even many liberals. [361]  Despite the criticism over the speech, Obama gave another $400,000 speech shortly afterward. [362]   Bernie Sanders  described Obama's speaking fees as "unfortunate." [363]  In May 2017, Obama traveled to Italy to give a speech on  climate change , but used pollution-heavy transportation to get to his destination. [364]  On June 6, 2017, Obama gave a $400,000 speech to the Chamber of Commerce in  Montreal  in which one of the topics he spoke about was "warning against income inequality and the concentration of wealth." [365]  After leaving office, Obama bought a house in D.C. for $8.1 million. [366] [367]

Several of Obama's failures as U.S. president were revealed shortly after he left office, as it was found that  Syria  continued to possess chemical weapons after Obama stated they were gone, that the Obama Administration misrepresented the release of some Iranian prisoners, and that the Obama Administration had unmasked Trump Transition officials (See:  Barack Obama Controversies  and  Obamagate timeline ). [368]

After leaving office, Obama started his own foundation, the Obama Foundation, and set to work on building his presidential center and library. [369]

It was reported in May 2017 that the Justice Department under Obama likely discriminated against veterans – in violation of federal law requiring the government to give preference to veterans in job hiring – by attempting to influence them to withdraw their applications. [370]

Obama did not give any mention of  Independence Day  on his Facebook or Twitter on that day in 2017 while he was visiting  Seoul . [371]

In September 2016, a  parasitic  worm, the  Baracktrema obamai , was named after Obama. [372]   As of December 2016, at least 15 schools in the United States have been named after Obama.

During Obama's 8 years in office, Democrats lost over 1,000 seats in the federal and state governments. [309]

Dinesh D'Souza  wrote, "Obama's legacy is to double the national debt & dramatically reduce US influence in the world." [373]

Upon assuming office, President  Donald Trump  wiped out much of Obama's last-minute regulatory actions through  Congressional Review . [374] [375]  Trump also adopted a stronger foreign policy. [376] [377]

Several major controversies have dogged Obama throughout his political career and have received major media coverage and prominence.

Obama's bizarre gaffes, or  Obamaisms , were frequent and embarrassing, but typically unreported by the  liberal media . Some examples are: spelling respect as R-S-P-E-C-T when he was attempting to sing that line from  Aretha Franklin 's famous song, spelling Ohio as O-I-H-O, and saying that we built the Intercontinental Railroad instead of the Transcontinental Railroad, saying "How's it going, Sunshine" when he was in the city of Sunrise, Florida. [378]  Many hardworking American businessmen took offense to a 2012 campaign speech about the economy where, referring to infrastructure improvements, he said " You didn't build that ." Obama offended  Poland  by referring to the  Nazi  death camps there as "Polish death camps." Later Obama apologized. [379]  Gaffes are inevitable for people with a high profile, but several of Obama's were very revealing ("you didn't build that"), and they show how the  mainstream media  tends to emphasize the gaffes of conservatives as opposed to liberals.
