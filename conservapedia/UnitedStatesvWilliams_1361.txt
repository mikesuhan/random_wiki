United States v. Williams  presents a question to the  U.S. Supreme Court  about child  pornography  and  commercial free speech :

In other words, the issue is whether a  federal  law that criminalizes pandering or promoting child pornography is unconstitutional even if the child pornography itself does not exist.  There is no question that child  pornography  itself is illegal and its possession results in long prison sentences.  But the Court will review an appellate decision that invalidated a law criminalizing commercial speech related to child  pornography .
