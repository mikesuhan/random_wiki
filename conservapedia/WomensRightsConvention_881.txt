The  Women's Rights Convention  was an 1848 gathering of women angered by their exclusion from an international anti-slavery meeting.  They met at Seneca Falls,  New York  to discuss women's rights instead. They promulgated a "Declaration of the Rights of Women" that resembled the  Declaration of Independence .
