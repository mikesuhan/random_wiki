Clusters of galaxies or  Galaxy clusters  are joint collections of thousands of  galaxies . It is assumed that these stars are hold in clusters by  gravity . The sumed-up gravity of all these  star  objects in cluster is however regarded as inadequate to hold these stars together. That's why contemporary main stream scientists invoke the existence of mysterious  dark matter  to account for missing volume of gravity. [1]
