Zoogenesis  is an  evolutionary  school of thought which postulated that each of the major types of life forms on earth evolved separately and independently from all the others. [1]   The evolutionary hypothesis of zoogenesis was developed the Austin H. Clark who was an American evolutionary zoologist who wrote 630 articles and books in six languages.  Prior to publishing his work in 1930 entitled  The New Evolution: Zoogenesis , Clark wrote in a journal article published in the  Quarterly Review of Biology  that "so far as concerns the major groups of animals, the creationists seem to have the better of the argument. There is not the slightest evidence that any one of the major groups arose from any other." [2]
