Homosexual activists and  liberals  have become angered in regards to ex-homosexual events and activities. [1] [2]   In addition, the Center for Reclaiming America cited the following account of how a  hate crime  statute was egregiously applied to an ex-homosexual:

The “hate crime” aspect, stemming from Ott’s belief that homosexuality is morally wrong, raised the potential fine from $1,000 to $10,000, and jail time went up from a possible 90 days to one year. Fearing the possibility of substantial jail time, Ott settled, and received 50 hours of community service plus a mandatory attendance at “tolerance” sessions conducted by  lesbians  at the  University of Wisconsin at Madison . A ground rule for the session was the premise that homosexual behavior is not immoral.

The entire process cost Ott almost $7,000 in legal fees. [3]
