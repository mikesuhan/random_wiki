To  prohibit  something is to make a  proclamation ,  edict  or  law  that a certain  activity  should not be undertaken.  This may range from a simple statement by  parents  that their  children  should not see a particular  friend  because of undesirable characteristics to  commandments  from  God  which for example prohibit children  marrying  their parents or working on the  sabbath .

During the 1920s the  American   government  imposed a ban on the manufacture and sale of  alcohol . This was known as  Prohibition .
