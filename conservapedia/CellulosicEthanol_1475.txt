Cellulosic ethanol  is  ethanol  made from biomass materials such as fast growing trees, corn stover, grain straw, forest products, municipal solid waste (MSW), construction waste and switchgrass. Ethanol from renewable resources can be used in place of  gasoline  to reduce our dependence on petroleum for transportation. Most  bioethanol  currently produced comes from  corn , but according to the  United States Department of Energy , cellulosic ethanol is more energy efficient and produces fewer emissions of  greenhouse gases .
