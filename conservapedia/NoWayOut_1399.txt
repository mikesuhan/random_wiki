No Way Out  is a political thriller set in the  Department of Defense , starring  Gene Hackman ,  Kevin Costner  and  Will Patton .

The premise of the film is that the government suspects a "mole" has penetrated the highest levels of the Pentagon, or at least this is an idea that is floated around when convenient.

Costner stars as a heroic naval officer who becomes an  intelligence  liaison to  Defense Secretary  Bryce (Hackman). In a series of plot coincidences, Costner's character falls in love with a pretty girl who conceals from him the fact that she's Bryce's mistress. When Bryce and the girl quarrel and scuffle, she falls off a balcony and dies.

Bryce gets his  homosexual  lover to cover up the manslaughter crime, and they plant the story that the "mole" was responsible. The irony is that Costner is the only mole, that he didn't kill the girl, and upon learning of Bryce's guilt he wants revenge on the man who killed his lover.
