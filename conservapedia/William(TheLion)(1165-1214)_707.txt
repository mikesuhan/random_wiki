William I (The Lion)  was the king of  Scotland  who gave Scotland its curent coat of arms, the 'lion rampant'. William also recaptured Scotland's  English  lands that had been captured (again) by the English. However, during his campaigns there, he was captured by English troops and taken to King  Henry II  of England. Henry told William that the only way he would be released is if he effctively ceded control of Scotland to Henry II, William refused, however, and when Henry II died shortly after,  Richard I  of England demanded money to fund his war in the  Holy Land .  Scottish nobles agreed to his demands, and paid a huge sum of money to Richard I. [1]
