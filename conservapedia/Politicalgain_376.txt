Political gain  refers to the unethical exploitation of a tragic incident or longstanding problem to promote the interests of a specific party. It is generally seen as not adding anything substantial to public discourse or benefiting the public, or as having an insignificant relationship to the incident or circumstance in question. In U.S. politics, both major political parties try to demean each other by complaining that the other is "only" seeking political gain.
