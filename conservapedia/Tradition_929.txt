Tradition  means information handed down from previous generations - often by word of mouth, but also in writing.

A major difference between branches of Christianity concerns the role of Tradition.  Catholicism  and  Eastern Orthodoxy  see the Tradition of the Church and  Scripture  as equally important. By contrast, for  Protestants , Scripture is of primary importance, and Tradition takes a secondary place.

The major  Protestant  view is that of  sola scriptura  (Scripture alone) which believes that all that is necessary for salvation is contained in Scripture. The Christian tradition may contain some things useful to know, but none of it is essential; Tradition is to be filtered in light of Scripture, retaining those elements which agree with Scripture and are useful to keep, rejecting those elements which are contrary to Scripture or not useful. Another view is  prima scriptura  (Scripture first), which is more willing than  sola scriptura  to rely upon tradition as a source of doctrine or morals, while still insisting that Scripture must have primacy.

From a Catholic perspective, Scripture is Scripture because the Church, through its Tradition, has defined the  canon  of Scripture, i.e. declared which texts constitute inspired Scripture, and which texts, however esteemed, are not inspired and hence not Scripture. So, from a Catholic viewpoint, to reject Tradition is to reject the means by which we know what is Scripture. But from a Protestant perspective, Scripture is not dependent upon tradition for its canonicity; Scriptural texts are Scriptural because the  Holy Spirit   inspires  them, which can be directly perceived by those readers of the text in whom the Holy Spirit is working; tradition may serve to communicate evidence of this inspiration to the present, but our knowledge of inspiration is not dependent upon tradition, but can be attained independently of it.
