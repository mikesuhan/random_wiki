Eric Henry Liddell  (January 16, 1902 - February 22, 1945) was a  Olympic   champion  and  Christian   missionary  to  China .  He is noted for refusing to compete in the 1924 Olympics in one of the qualifying races for the 100m dash (and the 4x400m relay for  Britain ), because it was held on the  Sabbath  of Sunday. He was criticized widely by the  liberal media  for his courageous stance based on  faith .

Liddell then competed and surprisingly won a gold medal in the 400m dash at the same Olympics.

These 1924 Olympic games, held in  Paris ,  France , prohibited  African Americans  from competing in the sprints and hurdles competitions.  A black athlete was allowed to compete and win a gold medal in the long jump, the first ever.
