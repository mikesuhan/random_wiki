The  Solid South  is a term describing the voting practices of the southern  United States  from the  Reconstruction  until the later 20th century, when the region voted solidly with the  Democratic Party . This voting practice was born out of the South's disdain for Republican  Abraham Lincoln  and the policy of  Reconstruction  pushed forward by the  Republican  northern congress. The practice continued and was encouraged by Democratic politicians who ran overtly racist campaigns and spearheaded efforts to disenfranchise black Southerners who might threaten their control.
