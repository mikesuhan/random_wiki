An  intermolecular force  is a force acting between molecules.

Dipole-dipole interactions are occur between permanent  dipoles  in  molecules . The strength depends on the distance and relative orientation of the dipoles. The dipole-dipole interactions are weaker than the  Hydrogen bond  but stronger than the Van der Waals force.

Interactions between dipoles and  Ions  are also possible.

A hydrogen bond is a force between a hydrogen atom and another particle.

The weakest form of intermolecular force is the  Van der Waals force , which is formed through electrostatic attaction.
