Djemila  ( Arabic :  the beautiful one ) is an  archaeological  site of a mountain village in  Algeria , near the northern coast east of  Algiers . The site has some of the best preserved  Roman  ruins in North Africa. Originally named  Cuicul  by the Romans, it was established as a  military  garrison in the 1st century AD to exploit and control the surrounding  agricultural  region. It has been estimated that it had a population of 20,000 in the 3rd century. [1]  The site was eventually abandoned in the 5th century, but not resettled by the Algerians. Being deemed by  UNESCO  "to bear a unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition or to a civilization which is living or which has disappeared; and to be an outstanding example of a type of building, architectural or technological ensemble or landscape which illustrates a significant stage in human history", [2]  it was decreed a  World Heritage Site  in 1982.
