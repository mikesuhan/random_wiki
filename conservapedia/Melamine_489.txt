Melamine  is a fertilizer that is high in  nitrogen  content.  In the  United States  it is used to make melamine resin, a plastic-like resin useful for coating countertops and cabinets. [1]

It is considered toxic as a food additive, and cats began dying from eating imported food from  China  that contained melamine. [2]

In 2008, milk that had been adultered by the addition of melamine caused over 50,000 children in China to become ill, several of whom died of kidney failure. Chinese milk products were recalled from stores all over the world. [3]
