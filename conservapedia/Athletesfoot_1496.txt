According to the  U.S. National Library of Medicine ,  athlete's foot  is a common  infection  caused by the tinea  fungus . It is not serious. Symptoms include itching, burning and cracked, scaly skin between the  toes . Tinea grows best in damp, dark and warm places, which is why it often develops between the toes. It can spread to the toenails, as well, making them thick and crumbly.

Athlete's foot can be contracted from damp surfaces, such as locker room floors... Treatments include over-the-counter  antifungal  creams for most cases and  prescription  medicines for more serious infections." [1]
