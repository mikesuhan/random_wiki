Construction of the  St Barbara Church  in  Kutná Hora  started in 1388 and its first architect was Jan Parléř. In the beginning, the construction processed very quickly. The church was built from sandstone that had been mined in the nearby quarries. The sandstone contains many seashells that you can see even today. Only four years after the construction begun 15 altars were admitted to holy orders and to every altar a special priest was ordered. Till hussite wars the building raised to half of its today´s height, but it remained in that height till 1547, when the middle three-body ceiling was finished. The Works on the church were only renewed in 1905. [1]
