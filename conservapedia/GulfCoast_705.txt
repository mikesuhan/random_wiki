The  Gulf Coast  is that part of the coastline of the  United States of America  that faces the  Gulf of Mexico , extending from the mouth of the  Rio Grande  in the west to  Key West  in the east. It includes the coastlines of  Texas ,  Louisiana ,  Mississippi ,  Alabama  and the west coast of  Florida . It is prone to extreme weather events, the most notable of which in recent years was  Hurricane Katrina ; more damaging still, however, was the 1900 hurricane and storm surge that destryed much of  Galveston  and killed 8,000 people. The main Gulf Coast city is  New Orleans ; other major coastal centres include  Corpus Christi , Galveston,  Pensacola  and  St Petersburg . Many coastal cities service the offshore oil platforms of the Gulf.
