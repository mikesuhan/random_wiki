The Gun Control Act of 1968  ( GCA  or  GCA68 ), Pub.L. 90-618, 82 Stat. 1213 was a piece of  progressive   police state  legislation enacted by  liberal   Great Society  President  Lyndon Johnson  on October 22, 1968. The  gun grabbing  law broadly regulates the sale of  firearms . It focuses greatly on  interstate commerce  for its authorization while ignoring the  Tenth Amendment  and  states' rights .

The  Black Panthers  marched into the  California  state capital fully armed, leading to the arrest of some group members. Because of the visible militancy of the group, they often faced  police  pressure. A number of clashes in the  Chicago  area left members of the Panthers and police officers either killed or wounded.  According to many Calguns Foundation members, the armed  open carry  Black Panthers were one of the reasons that  gun control  increased in America, especially the Gun Control Act of 1968.
