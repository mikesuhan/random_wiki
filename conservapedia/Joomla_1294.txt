It's use has been well publicised in magazine Web Designer.  It was spoken of well as a compromise of ease of use of wordpress, and large amount of optional customization of Drupal.  It originates from the Swahili word Jumla, meaning "all together".  Its mission is to provide a flexible platform of digital publishing and collaboration.  Joomla is written in PHP and stores data in a MySQL database.  Eddie and a team of developers set it up as an open-source project.  A non-profit foundation, Open Source Matters (www.opensourcematters.org) was set up to guarantee that it remains free.
