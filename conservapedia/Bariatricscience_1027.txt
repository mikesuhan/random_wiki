Two of the major risk factors for becoming  obese  according to the  Mayo Clinic  are poor dietary choices and inactivity. [4]   Most individuals are overweight due to their dietary and exercise habits. [5]

Obesity is positively associated with impulsiveness, lower  self-discipline  and  neuroticism . [6]  In addition, many people overeat in response to negative  emotions  such as  depression ,  anger ,  anxiety  and boredom. [7] [8] [9]

Although obesity is usually the result of overeating and lack of exercise, in a small percentage of cases excess weight gain is a symptom of a  disease  such as hypothyroidism or Cushing's syndrome. [10]

Although many people attempt to excuse away their overweight condition on their  genetic  makeup rather than exercise self-discipline when it comes to their diet and exercise habits, according to the  Harvard University  School of Public Health, most people can maintain a healthy weight through the establishment of healthy habits and maintaining an environment conducive to good health (emptying their refrigerator and cupboards of junk foods, etc.). [11]

The  Harvard University  School of Public Health declares in their article  Genes  are not destiny :

In 2009, an Australian university study was done concerning the association between leisure time internet and computer use with being overweight/ obese  and also sedentary. [13]  The study concluded: "These findings suggest that, apart from nutritional and physical activity interventions, it may also be necessary to decrease time spent in sedentary behaviors, such as leisure-time Internet and computer use, in order to reduce the prevalence of overweight and obesity." [14]

In the journal article  Religion, self-regulation, and self-control: Associations, explanations, and implications , psychologists McCullough and Willoughby theorize that many of the positive links of religiousness with health and social behavior may be caused by religion's beneficial influences on  self-control /self-regulation. [15] [16]  Furthermore, a 2012 Queen's University study published in  Psychological Science  found that religion replenishes self-control. [17] [18]   Also, numerous studies indicate that those who engage in regular spiritual practices have lower mortality rates. [19] [20]

According to the  Gallup Inc. , "Very religious Americans are more likely to practice healthy behaviors than those who are moderately religious or nonreligious." [21]
