In the  midterm elections of 1990 , the  Democratic Party  gained 7-seats in the  U.S. House of Representatives  and one-seat in the  U.S. Senate  from the  Republican Party , slightly increasing its already sizable majority.

The campaign was dominated by crisis in  Kuwait , a looming economic recession, and President  George H.W. Bush 's declining approval ratings. The results indicated an anti-incumbent mood, with six Democrats and nine Republicans in the House defeated for reelection. Minority Whip  Newt Gingrich  was barely reelected with 50% of the vote in his  Georgia  district. Notable freshmen included future  Speaker of the House   John Boehner  of  Ohio , Independent  Bernie Sanders  of  Vermont , and  Gary Franks  of  Connecticut , the first black Republican elected to the U.S. House since 1932.

Political science professor  Paul Wellstone  pulled a major upset by defeating well funded Republican Senator  Rudy Boschwitz  in  Minnesota . Conservative Senator  Jesse Helms  of  North Carolina  was narrowly reelected with 52% of the vote, after airing a controversial advertisement on racial quotas that featured a white man's hands ripping up a rejection letter from an employer. In  New Jersey , Democratic Senator  Bill Bradley  faced a surprisingly close race against Republican  Christine Todd Whitman , which helped propel her to being elected governor in 1993.
