A  ZIP code  is a five- digit   numeric   code  used by the  United States Postal Service  in sorting  mail . The first digit indicates a group of  states ; the second and third, a region of a state or a large  city ; and the fourth and fifth, a small  town , a delivery area in a larger town or city, a particular postal facility, or a particular large mail recipient.  Extensions of the ZIP code include the nine-digit ZIP+4 code and the 11-digit ABC (Advanced Bar Coding) code.

ZIP codes were introduced by the Postal Service in 1963, with a massive advertising campaign feature "Mr. Zip," which encouraged Americans to use the numbers. [1]   "ZIP" is an acronym for "Zone Improvement Plan."

ZIP codes are encoded into barcodes, using a redundant binary code with tall lines to represent the bit "1" and short lines to represent the bit "0," and printed on mail.  A "1" (tall line) starts and ends the ZIP code, and immediately before the final "1" comes a  checksum  digit which, when added to all of the digits of the ZIP code, adds to a multiple of 10.  The code scheme is chosen so that each digit's binary equivalent has exactly two "1"'s.  Digits are encoded as follows:
