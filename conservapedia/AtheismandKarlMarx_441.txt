Karl Marx , the most important philosopher of  Communism , was born into a Jewish family. Later he become an Atheist and Evolutionist. He also made anti-semite statements like "Money is the jealous god of Israel, in face of which no other god may exist", "The god of the Jews has become secularized and has become the god of the world. The bill of exchange is the real god of the Jew. His god is only an illusory bill of exchange", or "What is the worldly religion of the Jew? Huckstering. What is his worldly God? Money.".

Marx stated: " Communism  begins from the outset (Owen) with  atheism ; but atheism is at first far from being communism; indeed, that atheism is still mostly an abstraction." [1]  He brandmarked also religion as "the heart of a heartless world." [2]

He also advocated mass murder and terrorism as being the key practice of Communism, being directly inspired by the Reign of Terror during the French Revolution. As he told Frederick Engels in their correspondences: “There is only one way of shortening, simplifying, and concentrating the bloodthirsty death-throes of the old society and the bloody birth pangs of the new--revolutionary terror. . . . [...] Once we are at the helm, we shall be obliged to reenact the year 1793. [...] We are pitiless and we ask no pity from you. When our time comes, we shall not conceal terrorism with hypocritical phrases. . . The vengeance of the people will break forth with such ferocity that not even the year 1793 enables us to envisage it. . . .” [3]

Marx was also an Evolutionist. He wrote the following about  Charles Darwin : "Darwin's book is very important and serves me as a basis in natural science for the class struggle in history."
