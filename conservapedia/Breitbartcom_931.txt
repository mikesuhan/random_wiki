Breitbart.com  is an up-to-the-minute news source founded by  Andrew Breitbart . Presently, it is a  conservative media  juggernaut providing breaking news stories that the  mainstream media  would suppress from the general public. Exposing  liberal bias  in media has proven profitable as Breitbart has created other successful news sites;  Breitbart.TV ,  BigGovernment ,  BigJournalism ,  BigHollywood , and most recently  BigPeace . Breitbart is such a threat to the left that  Media Matters  constantly harasses them with misinformation campaigns. The Breitbart properties have provided some of the most ground-breaking news stories over the last several years and can be credited with taking down  ACORN  and exposing  race baiting  against the  Tea Party movement  by  Democrat  politicians. Per their website,

In 2016, Breitbart News ranked 29th in overall internet traffic according to Alexa. [1]  It played an influential role in the media and in the  2016 presidential election . [2] [3] [4]  Despite being a conservative news outlet, it has taken certain liberal positions at times, such as firing an editor in June 2017 for posting Tweets in opposition to Islam and Islamic immigration.

In its quest for ad revenue, Breitbart's overall web presentation is less  than family friendly with its right hand column running click bait for stories about "wardrobe malfunction" and photos of women wearing tight T-shirts imprinted with "not silicone." While its own content is conservative, the photos and links served up by its advertisers are not.

For example, the page about President Trump's order banning transgender people from serving in the military [6] , has a right-column item showing what might be taken as a woman having an orgasm, with a link to an article "15 Movies Where They Really Did It".  The article lists, among others, the movie  Ken Park , stating that "The boinking [sic] scenes in this film are all awkward, all real, and all completely unsimulated."
