Eton College , located in Eton,  Berkshire ,  England , is one of Britain's most prestigious public (US = private) schools. It was founded in 1440 by King Henry VI as a charity school to provide free education for poor boys but ironically is now one of the most expensive schools in the country, charging around £26,000 (approx. US$53,000) per year for board and tuition.  Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington, receives credit for penning the famous observation that England's battles are “won on the playing fields of Eton,” and while the quote is likely misattributed, the thrust of the statement was for centuries quite apt. Old Etonians have won more Victoria Crosses, the United Kingdom's highest award for bravery in the face of the enemy, than the alumni of any other school.
