Grassroots lobbying  consists of encouraging citizens to contact their elected officials about pending legislation or other matters of public concern.  This differs from traditional lobbying, which consists of communicating directly with legislators or their staff to persuade them to vote a certain way on pending legislation.

The very first bill introduced in the  U.S. Senate  (S. 1) after the Democrats regained a majority in 2007 is a proposal to regulate grassroots lobbying.  The bill was drafted by Senators  Joe Lieberman  (D-CT) and Levin (D-MI).
