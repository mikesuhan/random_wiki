Wire  refers to a single, typically  cylindrical , flexible rod or strand of metal. Wires are commonly to  conduct   electricity  or  radio or telecommunications signals , or to bear  mechanical  or structural loads.  Wire gauges  come in various  standard  sizes. These wore standards are expressed in terms of a  gauge   number .

The term  wire  is also used more loosely to mean a bundle of such strands, e.g. 'multistranded wire' - which is more correctly called a  cable  in  electricity  or a wire rope in  mechanics .

Wire is available in stranded, solid core or braided types.
