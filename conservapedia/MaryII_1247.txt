Mary II  (1662-1694) was the daughter of  James II .  Following the "Glorious Revolution" of 1688 she was invited to succeed and expelled her father.  She co-ruled as Queen of  England ,  Ireland  and  Scotland  with her husband  William III  ("William of Orange") as king. William made all the decisions, but she was far more popular. After her death in 1694, William continued as king until his death in 1702.
