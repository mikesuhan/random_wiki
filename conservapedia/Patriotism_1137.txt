Patriotism  means  love  or  devotion  and  duty  to one's country or homeland.

The word  patriot  comes from  Latin ; the root is the same as that of "father":  pater .

The  Roman  poet  Horace  wrote "Dulce et decorum est pro Patria mori", which means "It is sweet and seemly to die for one's country." [1]

Later, American satirist  Ambrose Bierce  would write "In Dr. Johnson's famous dictionary patriotism is defined as the last resort of a scoundrel. With all due respect to an enlightened but inferior lexicographer I beg to submit that it is the first." [2]

Later still,  World War I   British  infantryman and poet  Wilfred Owen  would mock Horace's words by describing a soldier dying a particularly gory death on the battlefield, and saying "My friend, you would not tell with such high zest / To children ardent for some desperate glory, / The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est / Pro patria mori." [3]

In rare cases patriotism has been a source of conflict for  Christians  in wartime. While their nation may call on them to do their patriotic duty, many Western pacifists believe that  New Testament  advocates  nonviolence .

Many western conservative Christians feel that patriotism does not conflict with Christianity as in their view their countries' political systems are based upon Christian principles.  However, this argument is dubious.  With the possible exception of Vatican City, no nation can truly be labelled "Christian", and given that people of other religious dispositions are allowed to vote - and these are numerous - it is unreasonable to expect a "Christian" outcome.
