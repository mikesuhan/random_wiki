Cinnamon  is a sweet, aromatic  spice  that is often used in baking. The cinnamon tree is an evergreen that grows best in a hot, wet, tropical climate, and has long been grown in  Sri Lanka , an island south-east of  India . [1]

Both true cinnamon (Ceylon cinnamon) and Cassia (Chinese cinnamon), are derived from the dried inner bark of the tree. Cinnamon sticks are made from long pieces of bark that are rolled, pressed, and dried. The spice is often ground into a powder and used for cooking. [2]

Ceylon cinnamon belongs to the laurel family and is widely grown in  South America  and the  West Indies . Cassia ( cinnamomum cassia ) is grown in  China ,  Indonesia , the Indies, and Central America.

Cinnamon was imported from China to  Egypt  as early as 2000 BC, and is mentioned in the  Bible  in  Exodus  30:23, where  Moses  is commanded to use sweet cinnamon and cassia. [3]

You shall make of these a holy anointing oil, a perfume mixture, the work of a perfumer; it shall be a holy anointing oil. [4] [5]
