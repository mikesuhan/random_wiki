Jesus Christ  is a historical figure verified by several  Roman  historians and other non- Christian  figures. [1] 
Whatever one's personal religious convictions, it is undeniable that Jesus Christ has played a massive role in  World   history .

In the years immediately after the death of Jesus on the cross,  Christianity  rapidly developed into a  Jewish  sect. It was gaining many members and as such was frowned upon and persecuted by both their  Roman  masters and  Jewish  brothers.  Paul  was a Romanised  Jew  who on the road to  Damascus  dramatically changed his mind and religion after receiving a  revelation  from  God .

Many of the changes brought about by Jesus are evident in the  Bible , primarily in his attempts to break down the corruption that was occurring in  Judaism .
Many of the sweeping changes in  Christianity  can be directly attributed to Him.

One example is the break down of the old laws regarding  food  in  Leviticus  11.
These laws limited the foodstuffs and  animals  that could be eaten by  Jews .
However, when Jesus was questioned by the  Pharisees  after eating food before washing his hands he states:

Nothing outside a man can make him 'unclean' by going into him. Rather, it is what comes out of a man that makes him 'unclean.'  Mark 7:15  (NIV)

Thus the new 'Jewish Sect' that was Christianity was allowed to eat any food whereas the original Jewish religion—whose adherents do not believe in the Divinity of Jesus—still to this day limit themselves to the foodstuffs laid down in Leviticus.

Although the first part of the verse is the most well known and quoted the second part is often overlooked [Citation Needed]  by Christians, particularly in modern times. "Rather, it is what comes out of a man that makes him 'unclean.'"
