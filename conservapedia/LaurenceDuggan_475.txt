Laurence Duggan  was head of the South American desk at the  United States Department of State  during  World War II , and later head of the Division of American Republics Affairs. He was also a  Soviet  agent. [1]

Duggan was a  Harvard  friend of  Alger Hiss  and  Noel Field . He was identified as a  Soviet  agent by  Comintern  courier [2]   Whittaker Chambers , [3]   OGPU  recruiter  Hede Massing , [4]   Venona   decrypts  and Soviet archives. [5]

Duggan provided the  NKVD  (Soviet intelligence) with confidential diplomatic cables, including from American Ambassador William Bullitt. According to  Boris Bazarov , Duggan told his Soviet handlers: "The only thing which kept him at his hateful job in the State Department where he did not get out of his tuxedo for two weeks, every night attending a reception, was the idea of being useful for our cause."

To protect Duggan's identity, Ignace Poretsky ( alias Ignace Reiss ) was murdered: [6]  A Moscow Center report of Poretsky's "liquidation" notes:

Poretsky was killed by OGPU agent Roland Abbiat, [10]  who would later go under cover as Vladimir Pravdin, [11]  New York bureau chief of the Soviet government news agency TASS, in which capacity he would become a contact of Walter Lippmann [12]  and I.F. Stone, [13]  and be suggested as the contact for  GRU  agent "Ales" at the founding conference of the  UN . [14]  He later served with the  United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration  (UNRRA).

In 1947, Massing told the FBI that she had recruited Duggan as a Soviet spy in the mid 1930s. Duggan told the FBI that  Henry Collins  of the  Ware group  had also tried to recruit him, as did  Frederick Field .

Henry Wallace  once said that if he became President, he would make Duggan Secretary of State; [15]  had  FDR  died in 1944, rather than 1945, Wallace would indeed have become President. [16]

Five days after Duggan implicated  Henry Collins  and  Frederick Vanderbilt Field  to the  FBI , [17]   Hiss  was indicted by a grand jury and the  NKVD  again  approached Duggan ; five days [18]  later, Duggan would jump or be thrown [19]  from his New York office window to his death, [20]  leading his friend (and father's  protégé ) Edward R. Murrow to broadcast a  scathing  denunciation of Red-hunters in the U.S. government for hounding an allegedly innocent man to his grave.
Following Duggan’s  death,  Archibald MacLeish  dedicated a poem to the late Soviet agent, denouncing "informers" (apparently  Hede Massing  and  Whittaker Chambers , each of whom had identified Duggan) for their "slanders" and "lies." [21]

In 1995, former  Kennedy  administration official Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. defended Duggan as "an  able public servant ." Duggan's code name in Soviet intelligence and in the  Venona  files is "Frank".
