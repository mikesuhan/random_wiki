Selective citation  is the practice by which  holocaust deniers  distort the work of historians by quoting them out of context in order to use their words in the opposite manner they were intended.

An excellent example of this can be found in the writings of Germar Rudolf, who wrote

When what Arno J. Mayer actually wrote was

While the exact words that Mayer wrote were used by Rudolf, the meaning was completely reversed. [1]

Another example can be seen in the attempts by deniers to discredit the testimony of Abraham Bomba, a barber at Treblinka. [2]

The entire trend is recognized in Samuel Moyn's book  A Holocaust Controversy . [3]

Occasionally the term  quote mining  has been used to refer to this practice.
