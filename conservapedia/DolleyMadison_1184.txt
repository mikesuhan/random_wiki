Dolley Madison  or  Dolly Madison  (born  Dolley Payne ) lived from 1768 - 1849.  She was the wife of  President   James Madison  from 1794 until his death, and served as  First Lady  of the  United States  from 1809 to 1817. She came from a  Quaker  background and was the widow of John Todd.   She is famous for having saved a portrait of  George Washington  from the  White House  before it was burned by the  British  army during the  War of 1812  and was known as a lavish and charming hostess when her husband was  Secretary of State  (1801-1809) and President (1809-1817).

She cut as attractive and vivacious a figure as James Madison did a sickly and anti-social one. Dolley is largely credited with inventing the role of First Lady as political ally and adviser to the president. They had no children.
