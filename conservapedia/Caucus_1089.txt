A  caucus  is a gathering of like-minded individuals either to discuss and advance certain goals (if they meet regularly) or to elect a political candidate as part of the primary system (if used in the context of a broader election).

In the electoral system of the  United States , each political party selects a nominee for office through a  primary , and a  caucus  is a type of primary for selecting a nominee.  A caucus consists of members of the party traveling to a central location to hear speeches, consider the issues, and then cast their votes to select the nominee of their party.  Because of the significant effort required, a caucus usually results in a more knowledgeable, devoted and smaller number of voters than in broader primary systems that simply consist of voters stopping by a local polling booth.

The term "caucus" was one of  John Adams ' favorite terms.  It is derived is from the Algonquian Indian language, having a general meaning of "to meet together."  In  Congress  it means an informal organization of Members of the  House  or the  Senate , or both, that exists to discuss issues of mutual concern and possibly to perform legislative research and policy planning for its members. There are regional, political or ideological, ethnic, and economic-based caucuses. [1]
