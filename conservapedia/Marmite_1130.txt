Marmite  is the proprietary name of a popular  British  spread.  Its main ingredients are  yeast  and  salt , although it also contains many important  nutrients  such as  Niacin ,  Thiamin ,  Riboflavin ,  Folic Acid  and  Vitamin B12 . [1]  Marmite has a unique salty flavor to which few people are indifferent, hence the company's slogan: "love it or hate it". Marmite is usually eaten on toast. The Australian spread  Vegemite  is very similar.
