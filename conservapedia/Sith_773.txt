In the  Star Wars  saga, the  Sith Order  is the main antagonist. Begun 6,900 years before the Battle of Yavin, [1]  the Sith are the practitioners of the Dark Side of the Force. Marks of a Sith included large, full-body tattoos, and they usually carried  red  lightsabers. Notable Sith include  Darth Vader ,  Darth Tyrannus  (aka Palpatine), Darth Bane (creator of the Rule of Two), and Darth Krayt (creator of the Rule of One).

"Sith" wasn't coined by  George Lucas .  It is used by  Edgar Rice Burroughs  to describe a large Wasp-like creature the size of a bull in the book the " Warlord of Mars ".  This term may have been picked up later by Lucas who was heavily influenced by early pulp melodramas such as Burroughs' Mars series.
