Pulsatrix  is a genus of owls of the family Strigidae, and found in tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America.  They are colloquially referred to as  spectacled owls  due to the pattern of the facial feathers, giving the birds the appearance of wearing glasses.

Spectacled owls are relatively large owls, with a length of 16 to 20 inches [1] . The head is roundish, and the three species have whitish to ocher-colored rings on the face, the distinctive "eye glasses" look. The eyes are large and vary from orange yellow to black brown. The claws are strong. The throat and the front part are separated from the rest of the body by a band which is different in color.
