The term  New Atheism , which first appeared in the November 2006 edition of  Wired  magazine, is frequently applied to a movement spawned by a series of six best-selling books by five authors that appeared in the period between 2004–2008.  These authors include   Richard Dawkins ,  Christopher Hitchens ,  Sam Harris ,  Daniel Dennett  and  Victor J. Stenger . [3]

Richard Dawkins said about New Atheism, "[O]ur struggle is not so much an intellectual struggle, as a political one: What are we going to do about it?”. [4]

Commenting on the New Atheism and British/United States politics, Steven Kettell wrote in the journal  Secularism and Nonreligion :

The four most prominent writers of the New Atheist movement are Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens and Daniel Dennett and they have commonly been called "the four horsemen" of New  Atheism .  PZ Myers  dubbed himself the fifth horseman of the New  Atheism  movement, but the term never caught on and he was mocked by some fellow atheists such as  Michael Nugent . [6]

Below are a number of articles which contrasts  New Atheism  with "old atheism". A common criticism of New Atheism is that it is not meaningfully different than old atheism (see:  history of atheism ).
