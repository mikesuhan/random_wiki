Planned Parenthood  likes to claim that abortion accounts for just 3% of its services. [1]  However, an examination of its finances reveals that much if not most of its  income  relates to  abortion . [2]  According to Planned Parenthood's 2007-08 budget, it received $1.038 billion of  revenue  from the following sources: [3]

Planned Parenthood's reported $374.7 million of revenue from "Health Center Income". Given that it reported performing 305,130 abortions, [4]  at an average cost of $450 (which lines up with statistics from the  National Abortion Federation [5] ), approximately $137.4 million of that $374.7 million Health Center Income came directly from performing abortions per analysis by  Live Action . [6]

Since much of its money comes from Government Grants and Services or Contributions and Requests ($595.5 million) likely related to abortion, in addition to this $137.4 million of direct abortion revenue, it appears probable that as much as half to two-thirds of Planned Parenthood's revenue relates to abortion.
