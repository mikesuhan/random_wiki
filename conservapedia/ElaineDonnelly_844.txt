A  movement conservative , Elaine Donnelly has long been the leader in opposing  feminist  distortions in the military that weaken our defenses and subject servicemen to injustices.  Her articles have been published in the Washington Post, USA Today, the Boston Globe, Congressional Quarterly Researcher, U.S. News & World Report, and the Naval Institute’s Proceedings, and she has appeared on virtually every major political show.  Her articulate advocacy on television under hostile questioning by liberals is legendary, and she is known as one of the finest debaters on television.

In July 2008 Mrs. Donnelly's exemplary communication skills created a firestorm in Washington, D.C., when she presented conservative testimony on the issue of homosexuals in the military before the hostile House Armed Services Personnel Subcommittee.

Elaine Donnelly served on the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services (DACOWITS) for a three-year term (1984-1986) during the  Reagan Administration . President  George H.W. Bush  appointed her in 1992 to serve on the Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces.

Mrs. Donnelly participated in her official capacity in numerous fact-finding visits to military bases, including the Army’s Fort Bragg, Marine training bases, the Naval Academy and U.S. Military Academy, a SEAL training facility, and several ships and submarines.

In 1997 Mrs. Donnelly became the first woman to receive the Adm. John Henry Towers award from the New York Naval Aviation Commandery, a tribute in honor of her work on behalf of naval aviation.

In May 2007 Mrs. Donnelly published her comprehensive analysis of the push for a co-ed military in the Duke University Journal of Gender Law & Policy, entitled the  “Constructing the Co-Ed Military.”
