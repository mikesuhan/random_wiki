Sigismund Vasa  ( Polish :  Zygmunt III Waza ) (1566â€“1632) was a  king  of  Sweden  and  Poland , and Grand Duke of  Lithuania . He was a member of the Vasa dynasty, grandson of  Gustav Vasa  and son of  Johan III  of Sweden and his first wife, Catherine Jagellonica of Poland.

While Sweden was and had been since the time of his grandfather  Lutheran , he was raised a  Catholic . This, his support of the Counter Reformation and his attempts to rule Sweden from Poland led to much anger in Sweden, eventually resulting in a revolt led by his paternal uncle, who after deposing his nephew became  Karl IX .

After the loss of Sweden, he continued to rule in Poland.
