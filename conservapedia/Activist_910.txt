The term  activist  refers to an individual who is vigorously and extensively involved in a political activity, either within or outside the governmental system. The term is usually followed by a central issue which the a person is an activist for; common activism issues include  human rights ,  terrorism ,  poverty , and  freedom . Although much activism is done in a peaceful manner, activist will sometimes use violent means in an attempt to persuade government or another authority to take their recommended action. One example can be seen in "anti-war" protests which have resulted in rioting and injuries of those opposing the activist ideals.
