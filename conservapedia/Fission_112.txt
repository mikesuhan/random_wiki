Fission  is the splitting of an  atomic   nucleus  splits into several smaller fragments of roughly half the original  mass .  The process emits two or three  neutrons .

The sum of the fragments is slightly less than than the original mass, and the "missing" mass constitutes about 0.1 percent of the original mass.  This "missing" mass is converted into  energy .

Fission occurs when a heavy atom nucleus captures a neutron.  Fission can also happen spontaneously in  nature .
