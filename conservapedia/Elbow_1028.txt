The  elbow  is the  joint  between the arm and forearm. The principal articulation is between the  humerus  and the paired  radius  and  ulna  bones, allowing for a hinge-like motion which bends the upper limbs. A secondary articulation at the joint, primarily between the radius and ulna, allows for  pronation  and  supination  (rotation) of the forearm.

The point of the elbow is anatomically named the olecranon, and is part of the ulna bone forming a groove into which the condyle of the humerus sits, forming the articulation.  The pit of the elbow is known as the anticubital fossa.

The elbow is a  synovial  joint.
