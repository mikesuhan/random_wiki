Bernard Eugene Meland  (1899-1993) was a classic  liberal Christian  theologian. He constructed a religiously  Theistic  worldview in sharp contrast to  atheistic  secular humanism. His worldview bridged knowledge and  Faith .  It was in the fashion of  Henry Nelson Wieman 's work.  Meland's work was however more deeply rooted in  Alfred North Whitehead 's than Wieman's.  Like all other  process theologians , he was a  radical empiricist , which he tied to his own idea of  lived experience [1]  calling it "appreciative awareness."
