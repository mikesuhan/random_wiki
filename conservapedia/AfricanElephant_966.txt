The  African Elephant  is a large terrestrial mammal native to the African savanna. It is normally gray in color, and possesses a long, prehensile nose, called a trunk, and large ears. As it is rather intelligent, it can be domesticated for labor or entertainment. In comparison to the  Indian Elephant  can attain a greater size, and is hunted for the sake of its  tusks , which may weigh as much as 70 pounds [1]
