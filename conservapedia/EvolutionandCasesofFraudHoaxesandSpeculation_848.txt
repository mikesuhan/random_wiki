A notable case of a scientists using fraudulent material to promote  Darwinism  was the work of German scientist and  atheist   Ernst Haeckel . Noted evolutionist  Stephen Gould  wrote the following regarding Ernst Haeckel's work in a March 2000 issue of  Natural History :

Stephen Gould continues by quoting Michael Richardson of the St. George’s Hospital Medical School in London, who stated: "I know of at least fifty recent biology texts which use the drawings uncritically". [2]

Creationists have written regarding the fraudulent nature of Haeckel's work and how a prestigious German science journal published his dubious work. [3] [4]

Intelligent design  theorist  Michael Behe  publicly exposed the fraudulent nature of Haeckel's embryos in a  NY Times  article. [5]   It appears as if Stephen Gould was irritated that the fraud was exposed in a manner that publicly embarrassed the evolutionary community - namely though a high-profile NY Times article. [6]

Dr.  Jonathan Wells  published a book in 2002 entitled  Icons of Evolution . Dr. Wells contends that the book shows that "the best-known “evidences” for Darwin’s theory have been exaggerated, distorted or even faked." [7] [8] [9] [10]

Professor Reiner Protsch von Zieten was a professor of anthropology at Frankfurt University for 30 years before he was forced to resign. [11]  It was found that he falsified dates on many "stone age" fossils which included a skull fragment named Hahnhöfersand Man which supposedly linked humans and Neanderthals. [12]  The scientific fraud only came to light when he was caught attempting to sell his department's complete chimpanzee skull collection to the United States. [13]  An investigation later established that he had also passed off fake fossils as genuine ones. [14]

The most famous case of a hoax perpetrated on scientists in regards to the evolutionary view was the case of  Piltdown man . [15]  More recently, although it might not have been the result of a deliberate hoax, the  Archaeoraptor  was a large embarrassment to  National Geographic . [16] [17]

The  Nebraska man  (also called Hesperopithecus haroldcookii) was a case of speculation. Nebraska man was promoted based on the find of a single peccary-like tooth (wild pig-like tooth). Dr.  Henry Fairfield Osborn , head of the Department of Palaeontology at New York’s American Museum of Natural History, wrote the following in the press concerning  William Jennings Bryan :

Nebraska Man was debated vigorously among evolutionary paleoanthropologists for five years until Dr. Gregory King Williams published a refutation of the find in the journal  Science  which ended the debate [20]  Nebraska man never gained wide acceptance by evolutionary scientists although it enjoyed coverage in the  Illustrated London News . [21] [22]

In addition, the science journal  New Scientist  recently reported the following regarding the fossil which was dubbed " flipperpithecus ":

In recent times,  despite their being little consensus on how evolution allegedly occurred  according to the various  theories of evolution , evolutionists have tried to convince the public of the supposed validity of the evolutionary position by increasing and frequently using the term "overwhelming evidence" or similar terms in relation to the alleged existence of evidence that supports their position. [24] 
For example, prominent  atheist  and evolutionist  Richard Dawkins  claimed in an interview with journalist  Bill Moyers  that there is "massive evidence" for the theory of evolution. [25]

Within the  evolutionary  science community and the  creation science  community, Richard Dawkins has faced charges of engaging in  pseudoscience  and also has faced charges of committing elementary errors. [26] [27]
