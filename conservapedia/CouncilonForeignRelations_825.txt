The  Council on Foreign Relations  (CFR) is an international organization founded in 1921, which has long promoted the involvement of the  United States  in other nations and the protection of international business interests. [1]   The CFR seeks to influence  American  politics by inviting presidential candidates to speak at its events and by encouraging potentially influential businessmen, lawyers and government officials to join its organization or participate in its events.  Many  American  presidents have spoken at CFR events.

It publishes a bi-monthly journal entitled  Foreign Affairs , which has long been influential in some political circles.

Membership in the CFR is complex procedure designed to ensure continuation of its globalistic vision. [2]   President  Ronald Reagan  was unusual among leading  American  politicians in shunning the CFR. Cong.  Larry McDonald  of Georgia was another strong opponent of the CFR.
