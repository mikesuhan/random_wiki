Hac in Urbe Roma  was a joint statement on March 24, 1966, between the  Catholic   Pope Paul VI  and the  Anglican   Archbishop of Canterbury   Michael Ramsey , calling for continuing dialog between the worldwide  Catholic  and  Anglican  communities.

Its effect has been overshadowed by division within the worldwide  Anglican  Church over the issue of  homosexuality , with some African, South American and American  Anglican  churches separating from the  English   Anglican  church over the issue.
