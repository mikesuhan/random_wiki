Obama Zombies ,  How the Liberal Machine Brainwashed my Generation,  is the first book from conservative  journalist   Jason Mattera  published by Simon & Schuster. Obama Zombies uncovers the true, behind-the-scenes story of the methods and tactics the  Obama campaign  unleashed on youth culture. Through personal interviews and meticulous original research, Mattera explains why conservatism’s future rests upon jolting the young masses from their slumber, yanking out their earphones, and sparking a countercultural conservative battle against the rise of the ignorant Left.
The lesson from 2008 is crystal clear: When true  conservatives  run away, Obama Zombies come out to play. [1]

For an entire year, otherwise clear-thinking members of the most affluent, over-educated, information-drenched generation in  American history  fell prey to the most expensive, hi-tech, laser-focused marketing assault in presidential campaign history.  Twitter  messages were machine-gunned to cell phones at mach speed.
 Facebook  and MySpace groups spread across the Internet like digital fire.  YouTube  videos featuring celebrities ricocheted across the globe and into college students’ in-boxes with devastating regularity.

All the while, the mega-money-raising engine whirred like a slot machine stuck on jackpot.
The result: an unthinking mass of young voters marched forward to elect the most radical and untested president in U.S. history.
