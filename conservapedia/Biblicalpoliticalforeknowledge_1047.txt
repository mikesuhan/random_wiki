As is the case with  Biblical scientific foreknowledge , the  Bible  shows a comprehension of knowledge of political events far ahead of its time. The 31 Proverbs and 150 Psalms are particularly rich in political foreknowledge.  Examples include:

In  Proverbs  1:22, the  Bible  predicts that "scoffers" (self-described as "skeptics" today) will shun and even hate knowledge, and thereby engage in  liberal censorship : [1]

How long will scoffers delight in their scoffing

In  Proverbs  29:9, the tenor of liberal Joe Biden's hysteria in the 2012  vice presidential  debate is predicted: "When a  wise man  debates a  fool , the fool rages and laughs, and there is no peace and quiet." [2]

The  Bible  predicts this odd phenomenon in Matthew 13:57, Mark 6:4, and Luke 4:24.  For example, Mark 6:4 quotes  Jesus  as stating: [6]
