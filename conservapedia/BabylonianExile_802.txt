The  Babylonian Exile  was the exile of the  Jewish  people to  Babylon  by  Nebuchadnezzar II .  By this time the Kingdom of Israel had already fallen over 100 years earlier to the  Assyrians , leaving only the  Kingdom of Judah  as an independent Jewish entity.  Under Nebuchadnezzar, the first deportation took place in 597 B.C. followed by another when Judah was overrun by the Babylonians and ceased being a nation in 586 B.C.  The  Book of Jeremiah  in the  Bible  records a third exile 5 years later as well.

When Babylon was conquered by the  Persians , the Jews were later allowed to return to the land of Israel starting in 536 B.C., but were still under foreign occupation.
