Hobbits  are a fictional people in  J. R. R. Tolkien 's  Middle-earth  stories. They appear prominently in  The Hobbit  in  The Lord of the Rings , whose main characters are the hobbits  Bilbo  and  Frodo Baggins ,  Samwise Gamgee ,  Meriadoc Brandybuck , and  Peregrin Took .

Hobbits first appeared in Tolkien's book  The Hobbit , which at that time was not yet part of his older stories. When Tolkien, upon writing the sequel, moved its setting to  Middle-earth , the Hobbits were incorporated into the Middle-earth mythology.

Hobbits appear as small humans, between two and four foot tall. They have furry hair on the top of their feet and leathery soles, making shoes unnecessary. They also have slightly pointed ears. Male hobbits do not grow beards. Hobbits have a longer lifespan than humans, many hobbits reaching the age of 100. [1]

Hobbits are a peaceful people and lead a simple, pre-industrial lifestyle. They live in the land which they call  The Shire , and also in  Breeland , both situated in Eriador in northwestern Middle-earth.

The traditional housing of Hobbits is the "hobbit-hole", or  smial , which is made up of a long hallway with rooms on both sides, built into a hill. Late in the Third Age these were mostly replaced in favour of single-story houses above ground; only the richer classes and the poor kept living in the traditional  smials . A notable feature of hobbit architecture are the round doors and windows. [1]

Hobbits use the  Shire Calendar , and the  Shire Reckoning  to count the years, beginning with the colonisation of the Shire in  T.A.  1601. [2]
