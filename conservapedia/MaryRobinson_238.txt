Mary Robinson  (born 21 May 1944 in Ballina, Co. Mayo,  Republic of Ireland ), served as the eighth  President of Ireland , and made history as being the nation's first female president. She served one term from 1990 to 1997 and did not seek re-election, though she can legally run again in the future if she wishes.

Ms. Robinson had achieved recognition before her presidency as a Senator in the Irish  Seanad  (Senate). While a Senator she attempted many liberal reforms of Irish society - most notably in the area of contraception, which was banned in Ireland until the 1980s. She also worked for gay rights, women's rights, and a campaign to save an historic  Viking  site in  Dublin  on which new buildings were to be constructed. This effort was unsuccessful. In 1990 she won the Labour Party's backing for her presidential campaign, and was elected later that year.

Her presidency was marked by her new attitude to Anglo-Irish relations. She became the first Irish president to make a state visit to Britain, and the first to meet with  Queen Elizabeth II . In 1997, rather than run for re-election, Robinson was appointed  UN  Commissioner on Human Rights. In 2007 she joined with  Nelson Mandela  and former US President  Jimmy Carter , among others, to form a group called 'The Elders', a think-tank dedicated to tackling world issues.
