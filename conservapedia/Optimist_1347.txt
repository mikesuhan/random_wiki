The term  optimist  was originally applied to those who adhered to the  philosophy  of optimism. This declared that the world was the best of all possible worlds, as it was created by  God . Therefore, even what appeared bad was actually part of God's perfection.

The term came to be used as meaning someone who looks for the positive side of a situation and anticipates the most positive outcome of a venture.

An optimist is one who looks at a glass of water that is half-full and half-empty, and focuses on how it is half-full.  A  pessimist  focuses on how it  is half-empty.

French author  Voltaire  mocked the concept in his novel  Candide  (1759), ridiculing  Leibniz 's notion that this is the best of all possible worlds.
