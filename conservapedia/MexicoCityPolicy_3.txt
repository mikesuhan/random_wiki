The  Mexico City Policy  prevents government funds from going to supporting foreign  non-governmental organizations  (NGOs) that actively promote or perform abortions in foreign nations, such as International Planned Parenthood.

President  Ronald Reagan  first instituted this policy in 1984, but  Democrat  Presidents, namely  Bill Clinton  and  Barack Obama , have rescinded it when they are in office. On January 23, 2017, soon after taking office,  Donald Trump  signed an order reinstating the policy.

On May 15, 2017, the Trump Administration massively broadened the scope of the Mexico City Policy to include any international health organization that performs or gives information about abortions, expanding the amount of money affected from $600,000 to nearly $9 billion. [4] [5]
