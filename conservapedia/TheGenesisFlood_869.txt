The Genesis Flood  is a 1961 book co-authored by Dr.  Henry Morris  and Dr.  John Whitcomb  that provides strong evidence for  a young earth  and a worldwide  Great Flood . It had a strong impact on the modern  creation science  movement.

In September 1953, Dr.  Henry Morris , an engineer, university professor, and creation scientist, went to Grace Theological Seminary to present a scientific paper he had written to the American Scientific Affiliation, which was meeting on the campus. [1] [2]  The paper was entitled "Biblical Evidence for a Recent Creation and Universal Deluge" and presented just that. [1] [2]   John Whitcomb , who had been teaching at Grace for two years already, was very impressed and impacted by the paper and decided to give up his belief in the  gap theory  view in favor of  young earth creation . [2]

After this, Whitcomb contacted Morris, who made clear of his intentions to write a book concerning biblical creation. [2]  In the weeks after this, Whitcomb was led to write his doctor of theology dissertation on biblical creation, and in May 1957 he finished the dissertation. [2]  At 452 pages long, it was entitled  The Genesis Flood: An Investigation of Its Geographical Extent, Geologic Effects, and Chronological Setting . [2]  In the fall of 1957, Morris accepted Whitcomb's invitation to co-author a book on biblical creation. [2]

A large reason for their collaboration was to counteract Bernard Ramm's 1954 book  The Christian View of Science and Scripture  which in-turn was written to counteract earlier creation scientists, such as  George McCready Price , and promote faulty and compromised old earth views. [3]

The book that Morris and Whitcomb wrote,  The Genesis Flood , was published in February 1961 by Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Company in  New Jersey . [2]  It was more than 500 pages long. [1] [2]

In 1959, the centennial celebration of  Charles Darwin 's  Origin of Species  was held at the  University of Chicago , and there  Julian Huxley  and other evolutionists and atheists stated that creationism was dead. [1] [2]  They were completely wrong. [2]

The Genesis Flood  was very influential among Christians, bringing them back to a belief in biblical creation rather than the long ages and evolutionary pseudoscience contradicted by the Bible. The modern  creation science  movement is largely a result of the book. [4] [5]  Even many evolutionists and evolutionist organizations, including  Stephen Jay Gould  and the  National Center for Science Education  acknowledged Morris as the most important modern creationist. [2] [6]

The Genesis Flood  was included in the book  100 Christian Books That Changed the Century  by William J. and Randy Petersen, and  Christianity Today  included it in the "top 50 books that have shaped evangelicals." [2]  In addition,  Ken Ham , who would later become the co-founder and president of  Answers in Genesis , which built the  Creation Museum  and  Ark Encounter , was greatly impacted by  The Genesis Flood . [7]

By the 50th anniversary of the publication of  The Genesis Flood , there had been 49 different printings of the book and 300,000 copies sold. [8]
