Morecambe and Wise  are one of the best known of all  British  Comedic Double acts of the 20th century. During the 1970s and the 80s their shows achieved viewing figures that were the envy of other broadcasters and their specials were eagerly anticipated as the Queenâ€™s Speech on  Christmas  Day. [Citation Needed]  Many prominent conservatives including Margaret Thatcher (then British prime minister) criticised the show for mocking religions while the bishop of Durham described their 1979 Christmas show as "a celebration of debauchery, adultery and vice that should not have some prominent a place in the holy season." Some have even speculated that the pair were, in fact, possessed by demons however this claim is not taken seriously by most people.
