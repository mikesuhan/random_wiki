Global climate disruption  is a term used as an alternative to " global warming ." Global climate disruption is a terminology change urged by the  Obama administration  to replace global warming, and was first used by  White House   science  adviser  John Holdren  in a 2007 presentation and again in September, 2010. [1]  Holdren's "global climate disruption" isn't the most convoluted term to grace the climate debate, however. According to a  Fox News  report,  NASA  published studies on the impact  humans  had on global climate and referred to the relationship as "inadvertent climate modification." [2]
