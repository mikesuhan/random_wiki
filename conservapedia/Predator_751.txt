A  predator  is an  animal  that preys on other animals. Animals that are not predators are called  herbivores  ( vegetarians ) or scavengers. Some common predatory animals include  bears ,  wolves ,  foxes ,  badgers ,  wolverines ,  cats ,  lions ,  tigers ,  eagles ,  hawks ,  falcons ,  alligators  and  sharks .  Animals that eat both plants and other animals are known as  omnivores .

Predators can also be interpreted as  humans  that bully and push around others.

It is argued that  The Bible  teaches us that all animals were  herbivores  before their expulsion from the  Garden of Eden  and there were no predators. Different interpretations of the  fossil record  support different points of view. [1]

While this verse is commonly interpreted to mean that there were no predators in the Garden, some hold that it means that all plants were given by God as food, i.e. that all plants could be eaten. This interpretation does not preclude the existence of predators.
