The  marketplace of ideas  is the theory that, in a  free market  of ideas, bad ideas will be subordinated to good ideas in the long run, as good ideas will win more adherents in the absence of governmental pressure to adopt one idea. The modern concept of the marketplace in democracy and civil society was developed by British philosopher  John Stuart Mill  in his famous essay  On Liberty .

This theory has become an underpinning of American  free speech  law, and the interpretation of the clause of the  First Amendment : as Justice Holmes wrote in  Abrams v. United States , mere disagreement with speech is never enough to condemn it: political majorities should be content to put their faith in the marketplace of ideas, that their ideas will win out in the end, and if they don't, that they didn't deserve to in the first place. [1]   Thus, the marketplace of ideas confronts "bad speech" by offering the remedy of "good speech" and competition to cure it. [2]

Of course, the marketplace cannot be expected to cure all bad speech.  Where speech constitutes an incitement to a breach of the peace, for example, the government should feel free to step in. [4]

It is a hallmark of  dictatorships  that they tend to suppress free speech, as they fear that their ideas  will not  stand up in the marketplace of ideas, and can only survive with an administrative crutch, or by the forceful suppression of dissent.  Dictatorships tend to fall. [5]
