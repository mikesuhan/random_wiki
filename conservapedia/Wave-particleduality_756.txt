Wave-particle duality  is the concept that matter and energy have both a  wave  nature and a  particle  nature.  It is a fundamental result predicted by  quantum mechanics .

Whether waves or particles are better suited for describing a system depends on the circumstances.  For example, light is usually characterized as waves in most every-day applications, but  photons  (light particles) must be considered in some situations, such as the  photoelectric effect  and most particle physics experiments.

The wave characterization may be nothing more than than a manifestation of the underlying positional uncertainty of a particle, which disappears upon observation.
