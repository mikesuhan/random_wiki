From 1981 to 1991 he represented Idaho in the  United States House of Representatives .

Senator Craig was born on the family ranch near Midvale, Idaho, which was homesteaded in 1899 by his grandfather. He later served as the Idaho State President and National Vice-President of the Future Farmers of America. Craig earned his B.A. at the University of Idaho in 1969 and did graduate work at George Washington University 1970.

In 1974, the people of Payette and Washington counties sent Craig to the Idaho State Senate, where he served three terms before winning the 1980 race for Idaho's First District Congressional Seat. He was re-elected four times before winning the U.S. Senate election in 1990 and was re-elected to the Senate in 1996 and 2002. Senator Craig served as chairman of the Steering Committee, a legislative "think tank" and action group for Senate conservatives. He was the youngest senator ever elected to that position.

Craig quickly rose in the Senate leadership in his first term, when his colleagues elected him Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee. He was re-elected to that position in the 106th and 107th Congresses. The Committee is responsible for developing policy positions for Senate Republicans.

Craig was dedicated spokesman on behalf of the people and economic base of Idaho who depend upon the  timber  and power industries. Many  environmentalists  believe his departure could be beneficial for  ecological  causes, such as  salmon  recovery, which may cause economic disruption and unemployment in a conservative "flyover" state.

On June 11, 2007, Craig was arrested at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport in a sting operation aimed to  entrap  homosexuals. [2]  Craig did not contest the charges so as to continue on his flight home to Idaho. He didn't consult a lawyer, and he never told family, friends, staff or colleagues about the incident. Craig returned to Minneapolis on August 8, 2007 and plead guilty to a charge of disorderly conduct. [3]

A few weeks after the plea the arrest story earned major press attention. Craig announced plans to withdraw his guilty plea and repeatedly denied claims that he was homosexual.

Craig also retained one of the capital's top public-relations experts, Judy Smith, who handled press for  Monica Lewinsky  and more recently for U.S. Rep.  William Jefferson . [5]   Craig received an unexpected boost in his withdrawal attempt when the  ACLU  lobbying organization filed a brief on his behalf.

In February 2008, the Senate Ethics Committee [7]  issued a public "letter of admonition" to Craig, charging him with "improper conduct," and unethical use of over $200,000 of his campaigning money for legal and other costs related to the airport incident.

Senator Craig served out the remainder of his term and retired in January 2009. [8]
