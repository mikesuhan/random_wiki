Voter apathy  refers to a low level of  voter turnout .  Voters are apathetic for many reasons, but the main ones are the high number of elections and the feeling that their single vote cannot have any real effect.  Only about half of Americans vote.

Older Americans vote more than young Americans, and people with higher incomes are more likely to vote.  Women vote more than men by a very small margin.  In general, whites are more likely to vote than blacks, but middle class blacks vote more often than middle class whites.  Hispanics and Asians vote the least of all ethnic groups in America. [1]
