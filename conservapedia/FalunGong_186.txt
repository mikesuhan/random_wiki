Falun Gong  ( Simplified : 法轮功;  Traditional : 法輪功;  Hanyu pinyin : Fălúngōng), also known as  Falun Dafa  (Simplified: 法轮大法; Traditional: 法輪大法; pinyin: Fǎlún Dàfǎ) is a modern Chinese "system of mind and body cultivation", founded in 1992 by Li Hongzhi. The teachings of Li stress high moral standards, respect for human life, and spiritual development specifically focusing on Truthfulness, Compassion, and Forbearance (真，善，忍). [1]

Since 1999, the  communist  government of the  People's Republic of China  has taken a harsh stance towards followers of Li, imprisoning many. Allegations of  torture  have been made by former prisoners. [2]
