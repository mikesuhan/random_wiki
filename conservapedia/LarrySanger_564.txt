Larry Sanger  created  Nupedia  and  WikipediaÂ®  while working for  Jimbo Wales . He left Wikipedia after Wales cut his salary by 50%.

He is currently organizing a rival, expert-edited wiki-based encyclopedia, known as  Citizendium .

Sanger's role in the founding of Wikipedia is a matter of dispute. Although Sanger came up with the idea of using wiki software to host their encyclopedia, Wales claims to be the sole "founder" of Wikipedia.
Citizendium's  FAQ page , presumably speaking for Sanger, describes him as a "Wikipedia co-founder." Digital Universe says, "He was the chief organizer of Wikipedia in its first year and played a key role in its creation."  [1]
