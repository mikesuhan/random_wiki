By order of  Communist Party of the Soviet Union  (CPSU) on 4 November 1956, a quarter million Soviet troops, supported by hundreds of tanks, drove into the Hungarian capital of  Budapest  and suppressed the Hungarian revolution.

In Budapest an estimated 30,000 people were killed by the  communists  and approximately 3 million refugees fled from their homes in Hungary. Communists claimed to have "crushed the forces of reactionary conspiracy against the Hungarian people". Criminals from the communist party still live in Russia. No one has ever been sentenced or jailed for this massacre of Hungarians.
