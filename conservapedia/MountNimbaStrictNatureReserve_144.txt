Mount Nimba Strict Nature Reserve  is a 69 square mile national park straddling the borders of  Côte d'Ivoire  and  Guinea ; the region also extends into  Liberia , but this section is unprotected and heavily exploited for  minerals  and wildlife. Including semi- deciduous  forest,  rain forest  and  savanna , it is called a "strict" reserve as, unlike many other national parks,  tourism  is forbidden. It has an extremely rich  endemic  flora and fauna, and more than 500 new species of fauna have been discovered, including over 200 endemic species. Of special interest is the endangered  viviparous   toad  ( Nimbaphrynoides occidentalis ), which occurs only in the upper  montane  habitats of Mt. Nimba. [1]  Important species of  mammals  include the  leopard , the dwarf African otter shrew, which was first discovered in 1954 on Mt. Nimba, and a population of  chimpanzees  whose behavior involves the use of stone tools. [2]  The actual mountain has the highest grade  iron  deposits in the world, being almost solid iron  ore . Mining on Mount Nimba accounts for approximately 1 per cent of world production, currently set at around 900 million tons.

There has probably never been any permanent settlement on the actual mountain, however there are ten villages in the immediate vicinity of Nimba with several thousand inhabitants, mainly subsisting through  agriculture . Since 1991, population pressure has been increasing following the arrival of refugees from Liberia. [3]

Hewn stone tools and chippings have been discovered in a rock shelter at Blandé at the northern end of the mountain. [4]

The reserve was inscribed as a  UNESCO   World Heritage Site  in 1981, under criteria 9 and 10 [5]  of the agency's selection criteria. [6]  In 1992, the Guinean government issued a decree entrusting a part of the Nature Reserve to an international mining consortium and the launching of a mining project. The reserve was placed on the list of World Heritage in Danger the same year. [7]
