Sea Shepherd  is a  radical   animal rights  and  environmentalist  group founded by  Paul Watson  in 1978, after his expulsion from  Greenpeace  because Greenpeace wasn't radical enough for him.  Watson had been a co-founder of the Greenpeace Foundation in 1972.  Specifically, he was expelled in 1977 over whether using "direct action" against  seal  hunters was justified.  Sea Shepherd's actions have included scuttling two  Icelandic   whaling  ships in 1985, in which animal rights activist  Rodney Coronado  participated, and ramming  Japanese  whaling ships at sea and throwing stink bombs at them.
