Xiahou Yuan  ( Simplified : 夏侯渊;  Traditional : 夏侯淵;  Hanyu pinyin : Xiàhóu Yuān;  Wade-Giles : Hsiahou Yuan) was a general under  Cao Cao  during the  Three Kingdoms  period of  China .

Xiahou Yuan was born in the county of Qiao. He was a cousin of Cao Cao and very close to him, even during their younger days. Allegedly, a young Xiahou Yuan once Xiahou Yuan took the blame for a crime committed by Cao Cao, though he was later acquitted through efforts by Cao Cao. In 190, he joined Cao Cao's coalition against  Dong Zhuo . He stayed with Cao Cao after that, becoming a general after the  Battle of Guandu .

Xiahou Yuan's record as a general was mixed. He was repeatedly defeated by  Ma Chao , but he ultimately succeeded in defeating Han Sui, Ma Chao's lord. He died at  Mount Dingjun , killed by  Huang Zhong .
