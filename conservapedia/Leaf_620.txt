A  leaf  is the main organ of  photosynthesis  and  transpiration  in  plants . Leaves possess many shapes, sizes, functions and manners of being. Leaves of most woody  trees  and bushes consist of a flat blade connected to the woody stem or twig via a slender, stick-like  petiole . The blade and the petiole make up the leaf. Hundreds, even thousands, of leaflets can occur in a single  compound leaf . A  poison ivy  leaf consists of three leaflets. Most but not all leaves, even compound leaves, are shaped in such a way that they more or less display bilateral  symmetry .

Leaves change colors during the fall season, making the fall foliage beautiful. This innate beauty, with no practical purpose other than to please humans, is one of the  Counterexamples to Evolution .
