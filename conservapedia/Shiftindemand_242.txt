Shift in demand  is a term of  Economics  describing change in the location or shape of the  demand curve . The shift is due to a change in something other than  price , because a change in price simply causes a movement along the curve.  A shift in demand may result in a different quantity demanded at a given price.

Examples of factors that could cause a shift in demand are a change in the price of a  substitute  or  complementary  good, a change in preferences, or a change in income or wealth.
