Snorkelling  is a water-sport/recreation commonly practiced in warmer climates such as the  Mediterranean  or  Caribbean  Seas. The purpose is to allow the snorkeller to keep their face submerged for a long period of time in order to view marine life below the surface. They do this by breathing through a bent hollow tube which sticks out of the water, called a snorkel.
Little practice or training is needed to snorkel; cheap kits consisting of just a mask and snorkel can be found at most tourist shops in popular snorkelling destinations.
