Julius [1]  Robert Oppenheimer  (April 22, 1904 - February 18, 1967) was an American theoretical physicist and director of the  Los Alamos National Laboratory , one of four laboratories [2]  involved in the  Manhattan Project  to develop the first  atomic bomb . He was also a secret member of the  Communist Party . [3]

Oppenheimer was born in  New York  in 1904, [4]  the eldest son of Julius and Ella (née Freedman) Oppenheimer. His father was a wealthy textile importer who had immigrated from  Germany  in 1895, his mother a scion of  Philadelphia  society who had studied painting in Paris. [5]  They collected original art, including a Renoir and three Van Goghs; they also owned a 40-foot yacht, [6]  and his father gave him his own 27-foot sloop. [7]  Precocious but socially backward, Oppenheimer began collecting minerals at age five, was elected to the New York Minerological Club at eleven, [8]  and delivered his first paper there at age 12. [9]  His shy awkwardness earned him the nickname "Booby" Oppenheimer among his peers; he was bullied, culminating in being locked naked in an icehouse overnight as retribution for alleged tattling. [10]

Oppenheimer's parents were of  Jewish  descent, but did not observe religious traditions, sending him (via limousine) [11]  to New York's elite [12]  Ethical Culture [13]  Society School. [14]  Ethical Culture, a  secular humanist  religion, [15]  is indifferent to the existence of  God , replacing the  Ten Commandments [16]  with a commitment to "social justice." [17]  Such an education conditions students to yield to "the totalitarian temptation," [18]  as  Nobel Prize-winning  economist  Friedrich Hayek  observed:

Oppenheimer never did embrace  Judaism , turning instead to philosophical  Hinduism . He apparently never studied  Hebrew  but learned  Sanskrit  and read the Bhavagad Gita in the original language; he would later list it as one of the ten books that did most to shape his “philosophy of life.” [20]  What flashed through his mind upon witnessing the  Trinity explosion , he said, was a line from this Hindu scripture:

Oppenheimer attended  Harvard University , where he majored in chemistry, graduating  summa cum laude  in just three years. [22]  One of his physics professors, Percy Bridgman, noted in his graduate-school recommendation that "it appears to me that it is a bit of a gamble as to whether Oppenheimer will ever make any real contributions of an important character." [23]  Oppenheimer went to England for postgraduate study at  Cambridge University , where he hoped to work under the  Nobel Prize winner   Ernest Rutherford . "But Rutherford wouldn't have me," according to Oppenheimer. [24]

At Cambridge, Oppenheimer became deeply depressed and jealous of the success of some of the people around him, particularly of his tutor, the future  Nobel laureate  Patrick Blackett, three years his senior. According to Oppenheimer's friend John Edsall:

In the fall of 1925, Oppenheimer left a "poisoned apple" laced with chemicals (possibly cyanide) from the laboratory on Blackett's desk. [26]  University authorities immediately informed Oppenheimer's parents (who were visiting Cambridge at the time) what had happened. According to a Pulitzer Prize-winning [27]  biography of Oppenheimer:

Oppenheimer went to Paris for a rest. His boyhood friend Francis Fergusson visited him there, and mentioned that he had become engaged. For the second time, Oppenheimer committed an apparent attempted murder:

In 1926, Oppenheimer left Cambridge for the University of Göttingen in Germany. He developed a reputation for obnoxiousness, once chiding a graduate student couple for what he called their "peasant" ways in not being able to afford a baby-sitter. [30]  He had a habit of interrupting others (including his professor) and commandeering the blackboard; the future  Nobel Prize-winner  Maria Göppart once presented Oppenheimer's faculty adviser, Max Born, with a petition threatening a boycott of his seminar unless the "child prodigy" were reigned in. [31]  Oppenheimer obtained a Ph.D. in physics in 1927, then obtained a National Research Council fellowship funded by the  Rockefeller Foundation . [32]  He did post-doctoral work at Harvard, then the California Institute of Technology, finally taking a position as an associate professor of physics at the  University of California at Berkeley .

Oppenheimer worked with other scientists such as  Hans Bethe ,  Niels Bohr ,  Enrico Fermi ,  Richard Feynman ,  Willard Libby , and  Eugene Wigner , who won Nobel prizes, although Oppenheimer never did. [33]  Oppenheimer's best-known scientific contribution was to suggest a limit to the size of  neutron stars ; larger neutron stars would collapse into  black holes  according to the  theory of relativity . But Oppenheimer is best known not for any scientific contribution, but for his managerial role as scientific director of the  Manhattan Project , under the supervision of project director Gen. Leslie Groves. His moment of greatest  insight  was when his subordinates came to him with the notion of explosive lensing. In that moment, he wheeled around the entire project toward that goal and thereby achieved the device that denoted over Nagasaki at the altitude of maximum throw weight, maximizing the damage despite the adverse whether conditions.

At Caltech, Oppenheimer had befriended Linus Pauling, and wrote him poems Pauling found "troubling," which included allusions to pederasty. Pauling broke off the friendship after Oppenheimer made a pass at his wife, Ava Helen Pauling, who told her husband, "I think he was in love with you." [34]  At Berkeley, rumors circulated of an affair between Oppenheimer and a homosexual student who lived with him, [35]  but in 1936 he began an affair with Jean Tatlock, a medical student at Stanford [36]  and daughter of Oppenheimer's fellow Berkeley professor John S.P. Tatlock, [37]  a contributor to  The Nation . [38]  Then, In 1939, Oppenheimer began an affair with  Katherine "Kitty" Puening Dallet Harrison . After moving in with Oppenheimer and becoming pregnant, [39]  Kitty abandoned her third husband, [40]  a cancer researcher at Caltech, [41]  to marry Oppenheimer in 1940, though he continued his affair with Tatlock until at least June 1943. During  World War II , while married to Kitty, Oppenheimer began an affair with another married woman, Ruth Tolman, the wife of Caltech physicist Richard Tolman, whom Oppenheimer testified was "a very close and dear friend of mine." [42]  The affair "devastated Richard Tolman," [43]  who died, according to  Nobel Prize-winning  physicist Ernest Lawrence, "of a broken heart." [44]  Kitty took to drinking. [45]

Oppenheimer had a history of pro-Communist associations, starting at Caltech with Pauling, a "long-serving  Soviet  tool." [46]  Later, at Berkeley, Oppenheimer's mistress Tatlock was a  Communist , [47]  as was his wife Kitty, [48]   widow of Communist political commissar Joe Dallet , killed in the  Spanish Civil War [49]  (perhaps by his Soviet superiors, or fragged by his own men, according to various rumors). [50]  In January 1944, Tatlock would be found drowned in her bathtub, in circumstances termed "suspicious." [51]  Some writers suspect Soviet involvement in Tatlock's death. Stephen Schwartz mentions "Khyron"—the Cyrillic transliteration of Chyron, ferryman of the dead in ancient Greek mythology [52] —which was also  Kheifets '  code name .

Oppenheimer’s brother Frank, and Frank’s wife Jackie, were also active members of the  Communist Party , [53]  as was even Oppenheimer's landlady; in addition, several of Oppenheimer’s closest friends and protégés among his graduate students at Berkeley, including  Giovanni Rossi Lomanitz , Joe Weinberg, David Bohm, Philip Morrison and Bernard Peters were Communist Party members. [54]

During the  Nazi-Soviet pact  (August 1939-June 1941), the  Federal Bureau of Investigation  expanded its surveillance of suspected Nazis to include  Communist Party  leaders. [55]  In 1940, William Schneiderman, the California state chairman of the Communist Party, met with  Isaac Folkoff , [56]  West Coast liaison between the Communist Party and  Soviet intelligence , [57]  at the home of then-secret (later confessed) Communist [58]   Haakon Chevalier . Also present at this meeting, according to FBI surveillance, was J. Robert Oppenheimer. [59]  The following year, Oppenheimer was added to  President   Franklin Roosevelt 's Custodial Detention Index, [60]  listed as “Nationalistic Tendency: Communist.” [61]

Upon his father's death in 1937, Oppenheimer inherited more than $300,000 [62]  (equivalent to more than $4.5 million today), [63]  and began contributing approximately $150 a month [64]  (equivalent to more than $2,000 a month today), [65]  at first via  Communist fronts [66]  such as the Spanish Aid Committee [67]  (aiding the  Soviet -armed forces in the  Spanish Civil War ), then directly to  Folkoff  or Communist Party official Thomas Addis. [68]

When he joined the  Manhattan Project  in 1942, [69]  Oppenheimer wrote on his personal security questionnaire that he had been "a member of just about every Communist Front organization on the West Coast." [70]  In September 1943, he repeated to Gen. Leslie Groves, head of the Manhattan Project, that he had "probably belonged to every Communist-front organization on the west coast." [71]  Later that month, Lt. Col. John Lansdale, Jr., head of Security and Intelligence for the Manhattan Project, interviewed Oppenheimer, stating: "You've probably belonged to every front organization on the coast"; Oppenheimer reiterated: "Just about." [72]

More than a decade later, when the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) was considering whether to renew his security clearance, Oppenheimer would change his story, writing that he did not remember saying this, that it was not true, and that if he had said anything along those lines, it was “a half-jocular overstatement.” [73]  Yet less than four months after writing this, when the AEC got Oppenheimer on the witness stand, he would again change his story: Asked, “If you said that to Colonel Lansdale, were you jocular?” Oppenheimer would admit under oath, “I don’t think I could have been jocular during this interview.” [74]

Oppenheimer confessed, "I was associated with the Communist movement," [75]  and admitted having subscribed to the Communist Party organ  People's World [76]  "for several years." [77]  Throughout the  Nazi-Soviet pact , when many other formerly stalwart Communists dropped out of the movement in disgust, Oppenheimer was, by his own admission, active in a number of  Communist fronts . He admitted having been a member of the western council of the Consumers Union [78]  (according the FBI, he actually became a member of the Board of Counselors of this organization), [79]  which was designated as subversive by the  Dies committee  in 1939, [80]  during the pact. In addition, from 1939 until at least 1942 [81]  (throughout the duration of the pact), admitted Oppenheimer, he was a member of the American Committee for Democracy and Intellectual Freedom, which was identified by  HUAC  as a Communist front in 1942 and by a special subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations as subversive and un-American the following year. [82]  Oppenheimer claimed not to remember sponsoring the American Friends of the Chinese People [83]  (identified as a Communist front by HUAC in 1944), [84]  but the organization listed him as a sponsor [85]  in 1940, [86]  during the pact.

In addition, according to the FBI, Oppenheimer reportedly co-founded the Berkeley Conference for Civic Betterment (identified by the FBI as a “ front group ”); was “a member of the Executive Committee of the American Civil Liberties Union, a Communist Party front group [in 1939, during the pact]”; [87]  a member of the Medical Bureau to Aid Spanish Democracy [88]  (identified by  HUAC  in 1944 as one in a "series of Communist enterprises"); [89]  a member of the National Emergency Conference for Democratic Rights (identified as subversive and un-American by a special subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations in 1943, and as a Communist front by HUAC the following year); [90]  and a donor to the Spanish Aid Committee, [91]  identified as a Communist front by HUAC in 1944 and as Communist by  Truman  administration  Attorney General   Tom Clark  in 1949. [92]

But Oppenheimer “was not simply a casual Popular Front liberal who ignorantly bumped up against the  CPUSA  in some of the areas in which it operated," according to John Earl Haynes, a Soviet espionage expert in the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress: [93]  "He was, in fact, a concealed member of the CPUSA in the late 1930s,” write Haynes, Emory University Professor Harvey Klehr and ex- KGB  agent Alexander Vassiliev. [94]  “Robert Oppenheimer was a member of a so-called closed unit of the Communist Party's professional section in Berkeley, from 1938 to 1942,” agrees Gregg Herken, a former senior Historian at the Smithsonian Institution. [95]  Stanford University historian Barton Bernstein, an expert on Oppenheimer, concurs that "it seems to me far more likely than not from the amalgam of evidence that Oppenheimer was a member, at least covert, for a few years." [96]

During 1938-42, throughout the  Hitler-Stalin pact , Oppenheimer was a member at Berkeley of what he called a "discussion group," [97]  which was later identified by fellow members  Chevalier [98]  and Gordon Griffiths [99]  as a “closed” (secret) [100]  unit of the Communist Party for Berkeley faculty. If Oppenheimer was not a Communist, he was the only member of this group who was not. [101]

In addition, if he was not a Communist, Oppenheimer fooled his close friends in this small, secretive group into thinking he was. According to Chevalier, “O. had been, from 1937 to 1943, a CP member, which I knew directly.” [102]  He added that he and Oppenheimer belonged to “the same unit of the CP from 1938 to 1942.” [103]  Griffiths, who served as the Communist Party's “liaison with the Faculty group at the University of California,” confirmed that among the “members of the communist group” at Berkeley were “ Haakon Chevalier  of the French Department and Robert Oppenheimer of Physics.” [104]

Oppenheimer was the primary author of a report signed “College Faculties Committee, Communist Party of California,” which he also paid to have printed, said Chevalier. [105]  It defended the Soviet invasion of Finland (during the Nazi-Soviet pact), calling  President   Roosevelt  a "counter-revolutionary war-monger." [106]  The report contains unusual wording characteristic of Oppenheimer’s writing, suggesting that Oppenheimer might at least have "had a hand in editing a draft," according to  historian  Martin J. Sherwin. [107]   MIT  physics professor emeritus (and former Oppenheimer pupil) Philip Morrison, an ex-Communist, [108]  confirmed that in 1939 (during the Pact) he delivered to the printers a pamphlet Oppenheimer wrote (and paid for) taking “the strict Party line in defending the Soviet invasion of Finland.” [109]

If Oppenheimer was not a Communist, he also fooled Communist Party officials into thinking he was. Paul Crouch, Communist Party organizer for Alameda County in 1941, testified that Oppenheimer had been a Communist at that time, and even described the interior layout of his home: [110]

Crouch: No, sir, none whatever. I met him in a closed meeting of the Communist Party in a house which was subsequently found to have been his residence at the time... and following that I met him at quite a number of Communist Party affairs in Alameda County. [111]

In 1945, in an Executive Committee meeting of the Communist Party branch for Alameda County, [112]  both the Communist Jack Manley and his wife, Communist Party functionary Katrina Sandow (alias “Katherine Sanders”), [113]  according to FBI surveillance, “stated that Oppenheimer was a Communist Party member.” [114]

If Oppenheimer was not a Communist, he not only convinced the Communist Party he was, he convinced Soviet intelligence itself. A 1944 report by  NKVD   San Francisco   rezident  (station chief)  Grigory Kheifetz [115]  states: “According to 'Uncle' ( Isaac Folkoff ), [116]  both brothers [Robert and Frank Oppenheimer] were associated with the fellowcountrymen," [117]   NKVD  code name for the Communist Party. [118]   That year, NKVD agents  Gaik Ovakimian  and Andrei Graur reported to NKVD chief Boris Merkulov, identifying the code name "Chester" as "Robert Oppenheimer, b. 1906, an Amer. Jew, secret member of the fellowcountryman org., a professor at the U. of California, works on ‘En-s’," [119]  i.e., 'Enormoz,' Soviet code name for the Manhattan Project. [120]  Merkulov, reporting in turn to Soviet Commissar for Internal Affairs  Lavrenty Beria , identified “one of the leaders of scientific work on uranium in the USA, Professor R. Oppenheimer,” as “an unlisted [ nglastny ] [121]  member of the apparatus of Comrade  Browder ,” General Secretary of the  CPUSA . [122]  Oppenheimer is also mentioned as an unlisted member of the CPUSA in a January 7, 1946 Soviet intelligence document from the Russian Presidential Archives and Ministry of Atomic Energy. [123]

In April 1942 Oppenheimer's name was formally submitted for security clearance for the Manhattan Project; the following month, observed William L. Borden, executive director of the congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy (JCAE), Oppenheimer "either stopped contributing funds to the Communist Party or else made his contributions through a new channel not yet discovered." [124]  Oppenheimer "appears to have dropped out of the party in early 1942,” write Haynes, Klehr and Vassiliev. [125]  According to Jerrold L. Schecter, spokesman for the National Security Administration in the  Carter  administration, “Robert Oppenheimer’s long time membership in the Communist Party of the United States was made secret in 1942.” [126]

FBI surveillance in 1942-43 reported that Alameda County Communist Party Secretary Bernadette Doyle told John Murra, a “suspected intelligence agent of the USSR,” that “OPPENHEIMER was a party member but that his name should be removed from any mailing lists in John Murra’s possession and he should not mention it in any way,” and told  Comintern agent  " Steve Nelson " (Stjepan Mesaros), according to a telephone intercept, [127]  “that she believes the matter should be taken up with the state committee regarding the two OPPIES, inasmuch as they were regularly registered [as members of the Communist Party] and everyone in the county knew they were Communists." [128]

According to  Kheifetz , "due to their special military work, the connection with them [Robert and Frank Oppenheimer] was suspended.” [129]  Ovakimian and Graur reported to Merkulov: “In view of the special significance and importance of the work he does... the fellowcountryman organization received orders from its center to break off relations with ‘Ch.’ [i.e., "Chester," Oppenheimer's code name] to avoid his exposure.” [130]  Merkulov summarized:

According to Sudoplatov, "My deputy, Leonid Eitingon, and I also instructed Kheifetz and Semyonov to turn over to our old moles all their confidential contacts with friendly sources around Oppenheimer in California." [134]  A 1945 Soviet code-message refers to instructions to “send GURON [‘Huron’] [135]  to CHICAGO to re-establish contact with VEKSEL….” The National Security Agency’s  Venona project  analysts identified VEKSEL as “Probably Dr. Julius Robert Oppenheimer.” [136]

In testimony before the  Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  (PSI), Crouch was asked about Oppenheimer:

Mr. CROUCH. No, sir, none whatever.

The CHAIRMAN. And if he were under Communist party discipline, he, of course, would be bound to turn over any atomic secrets to them that he had available?

Mr. CROUCH. That the party directed.

The CHAIRMAN. And naturally they would be interested in any atomic information he had?

Mr. CROUCH. Yes, sir. Just as a matter of fact, the Communist Party might have chosen to direct him to turn over the information; they might have chosen to direct him to appoint other Communists to key positions who would in turn, turn over the information. It is a matter of record that Dr. Oppenheimer has appointed many Communists to key positions to the atomic energy program..." [137]

According to Sudoplatov, "Oppenheimer, together with Fermi and Szilard, helped us place moles in Tennessee, Los Alamos and Chicago as assistants in those three labs." [138]  Among those Oppenheimer brought into Los Alamos were his former grad students Bohm, Peters and  Lomanitz ; his brother Frank; and David Hawkins—all of whom were well known to him to be “members of the Communist Party or closely associated with activities of the Communist Party.” [139]  Frank testified that he was a member (under the cover name "Frank Fulsome") from 1937 until 1940 or '41; [140]  Hawkins testified that he was a member at Berkeley from 1938 to 1943; [141]  Bohm officially joined the Communist Party in 1942 [142]  and later testified that he was a member at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory during  World War II . [143]

In 1942, FBI surveillance recorded Lomanitz telling Nelson he was working on a highly secret weapon; Nelson advised Lomanitz to keep his Party activity quiet [144]  as he was now considered a member of the underground. [145]  Oppenheimer said he knew "for a fact" by August 1943 that Lomanitz was a Communist Party member. [146]  Yet when, following an espionage investigation, [147]  the Army released Lomanitz from Berkeley, causing him to lose his draft deferment, Oppenheimer sent an "urgent request" by telegram, urging Lomanitz' "continued availability to project," [148]  and subsequently attempted to get the Army to release Lomanitz to return to the Radiation Laboratory. [149]

In 1949, just before Lomanitz was to testify before HUAC, Oppenheimer met him on a sidewalk in Princeton, N.J., (where presumably "the FBI found it difficult to monitor his conversations"), [150]  and discussed what he would say to the committee. Oppenheimer testified  that the meeting was by chance, and that he only advised Lomanitz to tell the truth. But when he testified, Lomanitz refused on grounds of potential self-incrimination to answer whether or not he had been a Communist. [151]

Oppenheimer also testified that he knew "for a fact" by August 1943 that Weinberg was a Communist Party member [152]  and had heard even at Berkeley that Weinberg had been a member of the Young Communist League. [153]  FBI surveillance recorded Weinberg, who had gotten into the Manhattan project using Oppenheimer as a reference, telling Nelson he had been a Communist Party member since 1938. [154]  Nelson warned Weinberg to burn his party membership book. [155]  In 1943, FBI surveillance recorded Weinberg (" Scientist X ") reading to Nelson "what appeared to be a technical formula used in the Project," which Nelson copied down. [156]  Weinberg told Nelson he had to return the formula to the University of California Radiation Laboratories in the morning. Several days later Nelson met with Peter Ivanov (a  GRU  agent operating out of the Soviet consulate in San Francisco, [157]  where  Kheifetz  was under cover as vice consul), [158]  and gave him a package. [159]  A few days later, "Zubilin" ( Vasily Zarubin , NKVD station chief in the U.S. from 1941 to 1944) was transferred from the Soviet Embassy in Washington to the San Francisco consulate. Shortly thereafter, Zubilin gave Nelson ten bills of unknown denominations. [160]

At least three of the five scientists under Oppenheimer's direct supervision leaked secret information about the atomic bomb to the Soviet Union. These include  Klaus Fuchs ,  Theodore Hall , and  David Greenglass . [161]  KGB archival data smuggled out by Vassiliev reveal that two more spies, Boris Podolsky (code-named Quantum) and Russell McNutt (code-named Fogel, later changed to Pers), were also at Los Alamos during Oppenheimer's tenure. [162]

"The secrets in KGB memoirs, Soviet archival records and translations, and NSA decrpytions of Soviet war time cable traffic, codenamed VENONA, reveal: The cooperation of J. Robert Oppenheimer in atomic espionage from 1942 to 1944...." writes Schecter. [163]  Herbert Romerstein, former chief of the U.S. Information Agency's Office to Counter Soviet Disinformation and Active Measures, [164]  agrees: "Atomic scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer performed work on behalf of the Soviet Union." [165]  Oppenheimer supplied the Soviets with classified reports on atom bomb development—in part via Elizabeth Zarubina (wife of  Vasily Zarubin ), who was in direct contact with Oppenheimer's wife, Kitty—according to Pavel Sudoplatov, Moscow-based overseer of Soviet atom-bomb espionage. In his 1994 memoir, Sudoplatov wrote:

Sudoplatov's allegations are corroborated by a 1982 letter he wrote to then-Soviet Premier  Yuri Andropov , stating: "Department S [Sudoplatov's department] rendered considerable help to our scientists by giving them the latest materials on atom bomb research, obtained from such sources as the famous nuclear physicists R. Oppenheimer, E. Fermi,  K. Fuchs  and others." [167]  Romerstein and Breindel comment: "It would have made no sense for Sudoplatov to lie to Andropov, the former head of KGB and dictator of the Soviet Union, who would have easily found him out." [168]

According to FBI surveillance in 1943, Nelson (who often visited Oppenheimer's wife in Berkeley) [169]  advised Weinberg "that OPPENHEIMER had indicated to him the basic idea of the project"; [170]  in 1945, Jack Manley would state that “Oppenheimer told Steven Nelson several years ago that the Army was working on the atomic bomb.” [171]

Merkulov reported to  Beria , "In 1942 one of the leaders of scientific work on uranium in the USA, Professor R. Oppenheimer... informed us about the beginning of work. On the request of Comrade Kheifitz, [172]  confirmed by  Comrade Browder , he provided cooperation in access to research for several of our tested sources including a relative of Comrade Browder." [173]  (Browder's niece,  Helen Lowry , was a Soviet agent married to  Iskhak Akhmerov , [174]  the leading NKVD "illegal" in the United States.) [175]  Schecter concludes that Oppenheimer “was being used as a Soviet intelligence asset by the Communist Underground to help obtain atomic secrets.” [176]

Sergei Leskov, science correspondent for  Izvestia , a Moscow newspaper in which the Russian government holds a controlling stake, reported in 1994 that Russian government officials informed him

In 1943, the Soviets tried to establish direct contact with Oppenheimer. Ivanov instructed George Eltenton (a British-born Soviet intelligence source code-named “Dorin”) [178]  to feel Oppenheimer out about covertly leaking American nuclear secrets to the Soviet Union, according to Eltenton’s statement to the FBI. [179]  Eltenton said he asked Chevalier to pitch the idea to Oppenheimer. [180]  Chevalier approached Oppenheimer in February or March 1943, but Oppenheimer failed to report the incident for some eight months. [181]

Overruling the objections of security officers, according to Groves, on July 20 he issued written orders that:

The following month, after Oppenheimer's security clearance had come through, Lieutenant Lyall Johnson, the security officer at Berkeley, questioned Oppenheimer about  Lomanitz , whom Oppenheimer had tried to keep on the Manhattan Project, even though he had supplied highly sensitive information to the Soviets. [183]  Oppenheimer stated that he had heard that Eltenton, too, had offered to supply technical data to the Soviets. [184]  Johnson immediately called Lieutenant Colonel Boris T. Pash, Chief of Counter-Intelligence for the Ninth Army Corps on the West Coast. [185]  The following day, Pash and Johnson interrogated Oppenheimer about Eltenton. Oppenheimer stated:

Oppenheimer then named Eltenton, stating:

Johnson asked whether "there was a particular person, maybe a person on the project that they were trying to pump information from."

Oppenheimer answered, "I have known of 2 or 3 cases, and I think two of the men were with me at Los Alamos—they are men who are very closely associated with me." Eltenton, he added, "had very good contacts with a man from the embassy attached to the consulate who was a very reliable guy (that's his story) and who had a lot of experience in microfilm work, or whatever the hell." Eltenton did not contact anyone on the Manhattan Project directly, said Oppenheimer, but through an intermediary, "a member of the [Berkeley] faculty, but not on the project." [186]

The following month Colonel Lansdale told Oppenheimer that "we have known since February that several people were transmitting information about this project to the Soviet Government." Oppenheimer said the intermediary, whom he still refused to name, was "an acquaintance of mine, I've known over many years," adding, "I know him as a fellow traveler." Lansdale confronted Oppenheimer, stating: "I have reason to believe that you yourself were felt out, I don't say asked, but felt out to ascertain how you felt about it, passing a little information, to the party." Then Lansdale struck home:

O. [Oppenheimer] Is he a member of the party?

L. I don't know.

O. He is a member of the faculty and I know him well. I wouldn't be surprised if he were a member, he is quite a Red. [187]

Groves did not believe Oppenheimer's new story, testifying that he "had the very definite impression that Dr. Oppenheimer
wanted to protect his friends of long standing, possibly his brother." [191]

But Oppenheimer insisted that what he had told Pash about the three contacts was actually just “a cock-and-bull story.” [192]  "This whole thing was a pure fabrication except for the one name Eltenton," testified Oppenheimer, who called his previous story "a piece of idiocy" that was "wholly false." [193]  Asked "You lied to him?" Oppenheimer answered "Yes." Asked under oath for an explanation of why he had lied, the brilliant physicist testified, “Because I was an idiot.” [194]  Despite this incident, Oppenheimer was still meeting with Chevalier a decade later, including once in Paris, [195]  where, again, presumably "the FBI found it difficult to monitor his conversations." [196]

The successful development of the atomic bomb gave the  United States  an enormous advantage over the  Soviet Union . Following the bombing of  Hiroshima  and  Nagasaki , NKVD Chief  Lavrenty Beria  "said we should think how to use Oppenheimer,  Szilard  and others around them in the peace campaign against nuclear armament," according to Sudoplatov. "Disarmament and the inability to impose nuclear blackmail would deprive the United States of its advantage." [197]  On October 3, 1945,  President   Truman  read an address to  Congress  stating that "atomic energy constitutes a new force too revolutionary to consider in the framework of old ideas." [198]  The speech advocated "the renunciation of the use" [199]  of the atom bomb, and proposed "international collaboration and exchange of scientific information" [200]  about it. On October 19, wrote  Henry Wallace , [201]  Oppenheimer "told me that the President’s statement to Congress had been written by  Dean Acheson ’s assistant, a Mr. Herbert Marks, [202]  and that he [Oppenheimer] had had something to do with helping Marks on the message." [203]

Two days previously, Wallace and Oppenheimer had attended a meeting at  Washington 's Statler Hotel [204]  with  Szilard , Fermi, Edward U. Condon, [205]  Harlow Shapley, [206]  and others. "The scientists presented in very vigorous terms the peril in which the United States now finds herself... chiefly... the threat to peace," wrote Wallace. "Oppenheimer said he very much wanted to see me and I made arrangements..." [207]  At their meeting two days later, wrote Wallace:

Within a week, Oppenheimer met with Truman at the  White House . Oppenheimer urged the President to surrender the U.S. nuclear monopoly to international control. Truman was outraged, telling  Secretary of State   Dean Acheson , "I don't want to see that son-of-a-bitch in this office ever again." [211] 
Nevertheless, Truman later appealed to Oppenheimer for help in "giving the army permanent control over atomic energy." [212]  Oppenheimer did just the opposite, using his influence to turn the army's control of nuclear power over to the civilian AEC in 1946. [213]  That year, Oppenheimer was one of the primary architects of the  Acheson-Lillienthal Report , which proposed turning control of the U.S. nuclear arsenal over to the  United Nations . [214]

During their June 2000 meeting, Russian President Vladimir Putin, an ex-KGB agent, told U.S. President Bill Clinton a story concerning "Joseph Stalin's decision to put his secret police chief, Lavrenti Beria, in charge of ferreting out the secrets of the American crash program to develop the atomic bomb during World War II."

In 2012, according to Russia's government news agency Itar-Tass, Putin amplified these remarks:

In 1947, Oppenheimer became Chairman of the AEC's General Advisory Committee (GAC) on Science. [217]  On September 23, 1949, Truman announced that the Soviets had exploded their own atomic bomb. [218]  (Within a month of breaking the U.S. nuclear monopoly, Soviet-backed Communist rebels would seize control of  China , inaugurating a regime that would eventually murder some 70 million Chinese; [219]  within a year, Soviet and Communist Chinese-backed  North Korea  would invade its neighbor to the south, launching a war that would claim more than 30,000 American lives.) [220]  AEC Commissioner Lewis Strauss, president of the board of trustees of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton (where Oppenheimer was director), responded with a proposal that the U.S. make it "highest priority" to build a hydrogen bomb (then called the "super bomb"). [221]

On October 14, 1949, one GAC member, Glenn Seaborg, then a future  Nobel Laureate  (and future AEC Chairman), wrote to Oppenheimer, “I have been unable to come to the conclusion that we should not” proceed with this crash program to develop an H-bomb. “I would have to hear some good arguments before I could take on sufficient courage to recommend not going toward such a program." [222]

Yet, ten days later, Oppenheimer told the AEC that among GAC members there was “a surprising unanimity—to me very surprising—that the United States ought not to take the initiative... in an all out program for the development of thermonuclear weapons.” [223]  He claimed that didn't know how Seaborg felt about it, as he “was in Sweden, and there was no communication with him.” [224]  Oppenheimer later confessed that he had received Seaborg's letter before he made these claims, yet he repeated them three months later, before the JCAE. [225] 
When nuclear physicist  Edward Teller , a  Hungarian   Jewish  refugee from  Nazi Germany [226]  known as the "father of the H-bomb," [227]  had sought Oppenheimer's support to build an H-bomb at Los Alamos in 1945, Oppenheimer had refused. Now, argued Teller, the need for an H-bomb had become urgent. Oppenheimer disagreed, signing his name to an official statement that "a super bomb should never be produced." [228]  With Fermi and others, he lobbied Henry Wallace to stop H-bomb development; Wallace complied, issuing a statement that “we should prefer defeat in war to victory obtained at the expense of the enormous human disaster that would be caused by its determined use.” [229]  As Teller would later testify:

Although he made no accusations, his testimony regarding Oppenheimer made Teller  a pariah . The left accused him of smearing an innocent man and  blamed him  for ending Oppenheimer's career. The hearing transcript contradicts that conclusion, but to some, Teller’s anticommunist views alone  were enough  to justify bitter feelings against him. Many  never forgave  him.

In 1943, Lansdale had asked Oppenheimer, "Do you know a fellow named Rudy Lambert [chief of security for the California Communist Party, identified in Venona as a Soviet intelligence source on uranium]?" [231]  Oppenheimer answered, "I'm not sure, do you know what he looks like?" [232]  Yet in 1949, Oppenheimer testified before HUAC that he had met Lambert half a dozen times before 1943, and not only knew then that he was a Communist official, [233]  but even described him ("A lean, rather handsome man, moderate height, rather an effective speaker in conversation.") [234]  The following colloquy would ensue:

A. Sure.

Q. Why did you ask Lansdale what he looked like?

A. I don't know that I did.

Q. If you did, Doctor, would it mean that you were ducking the question?

A. I would think so. [235]

After this testimony was leaked to the press, [246]  Condon, then Director of the Commerce Department's National Bureau of Standards (dealing with classified data on nuclear weapons, radar, and guided missiles), wrote a letter to the editor containing “a severe attack on Dr. Oppenheimer” [247]  and tried to start various rumors alleging that Oppenheimer was either losing his mind or converting to the  Catholic Church . [248]  He also wrote Oppenheimer a letter accusing him of trying to "buy immunity for yourself by turning informer" [249]  and demanding that he "try to make restitution," threatening that if Oppenheimer's own "file were ever made public, it would be a much bigger flap": [250]  "You know very well that once these people decide to go into your own dossier and make it public that it will make the 'revelations' that you have made so far look pretty tame." [251]

Under pressure from Condon and others, Oppenheimer wrote a letter to the editor that "retracted some of the testimony," stating that "Dr. Peters has recently informed me... that I was wrong in believing... that he had ever held a membership in the Communist Party." [252]

Oppenheimer "was very much influenced [in 1942]... by the influence of Dr. Condon," according to Groves. Condon, Groves testified, "did a tremendous amount of damage at Los Alamos in the initial setup." [253]  Groves testified that he believed that Condon was "responsible for the rules—that tended to break down compartmentalization" at Los Alamos, thus making it difficult to control the diffusion of secrets and prevent espionage. Just before the  Trinity explosion , the Soviets scheduled a scientific conference in Moscow. The  Kremlin  invited several U.S. scientists to attend—a fact that a member of the  State Department  tried to keep secret from the Army, according to Groves. Among those invited was Condon, but the U.S. government revoked his passport to prevent him from attending. Condon "made a terrific battle to go," testified Groves:

Pursuant to  President   Eisenhower 's Executive Order 10450 of April 27, 1953, new security standards were applied to all federal officials, including Oppenheimer. On May 15, Senator  Joseph McCarthy  (R-WI), Chairman of the  PSI , asked FBI Director  J. Edgar Hoover  if the Bureau would object to the PSI holding hearings on Oppenheimer. Hoover told him that the FBI had no objections. Syndicated columnist Joseph Alsop, a blood relative of both Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt (and a friend of Oppenheimer's) delivered a seven-page letter to the White House asking Ike to block the investigation. [255]

The prospect of a McCarthy hearing spooked the administration into finally taking action: on June 22, Strauss asked Hoover to get McCarthy to hold off until the AEC could conduct its own hearings. In November, Borden wrote to Hoover, stating in his “exhaustively considered opinion, based upon years of study, of the available classified evidence, that more probably than not J. Robert Oppenheimer is an agent of the Soviet Union." [256]  The following month (the same month Oppenheimer met with Chevalier in Paris), after reviewing material brought to his attention by the Department of Justice, Eisenhower, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization and the AEC Chairman, ordered that, pending a security review, “a blank wall be placed between Dr. Oppenheimer and any secret data,” [257]  and the AEC notified Oppenheimer that his clearance was under review, sending him a letter laying out charges against him.

On March 4, 1954, Oppenheimer sent a written response to AEC General Manager K.D. Nichols. The following month, Oppenheimer released the text of the administration's charges to the press, along with his response.

On April 12, the AEC's Personnel Security Board (PSB) opened hearings on the charges. The PSB was a three-member panel headed by former Secretary of the Army Gordon Gray, President of the University of North Carolina (after whom it is sometimes referred to as the “Gray board”). Also on the PSB were Ward V. Evans, professor emeritus of chemistry at Loyola University of Chicago; and Thomas Morgan, 66, a retired businessman.

Oppenheimer was represented  pro bono  by the white shoe firm [258]  of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, joined by former AEC general counsel Herbert Marks, the former Special Assistant to Under Secretary of State  Dean Acheson  who, with Oppenheimer's help, had written Truman's 1945 address proposing international sharing of nuclear secrets.

After eight weeks of testimony and cross-examination, and exhibits including transcripts and FBI reports, the panel voted 2-1 to strip Oppenheimer of his “Q clearance” access to atomic secrets. Gray and Morgan carried the majority, with Evans dissenting. Joseph and Stewart Alsop, "long-standing Oppenheimer partisans," used their influential syndicated columns to put forward a conspiracy theory: the Gray board's findings, alleged the Alsops, were part of a conspiracy by AEC Chairman Strauss to even an old personal grudge against Oppenheimer. Despite the fact that it "conveniently overlooked the matter of Gray's record and integrity," [259]  the left adopted the Alsops' conspiracy theory as the dogmatic explanation of Oppenheimer's security problems.

Oppenheimer appealed the PSB's decision to the full Atomic Energy Commission. Joining his legal team was former Democratic Party presidential candidate John W. Davis, [260]  fresh from his defeated defense of segregation in  Brown v. Board of Education . [261]  Davis had previously testified as a character witness for Soviet agent  Alger Hiss . [262]

Citing “proof of fundamental defects in his ‘character’,” to wit, “his associations with persons known to him to be Communists,” which associations, said the AEC, “have extended far beyond the tolerable limits of prudence and self-restraint which are to be expected of one holding the high positions that the Government has continuously entrusted to him since 1942,” the commission upheld the decision stripping the former chairman of its own GAC [263]  of his security clearance. [264]

Oppenheimer died in Princeton, New Jersey on February 18, 1967 from throat cancer. [265]

In 1963, President  Johnson  reinstated Oppenheimer's clearance, and the AEC awarded him the Enrico Fermi Award. [266]

In June 1997, the KGB museum in Moscow featured an exhibit of "leading atomic espionage agents and espionage documents." The exhibit featured Oppenheimer's image, displayed along with a photograph of convicted Soviet atomic spy Klaus Fuchs, and a shot of a Manhattan Project laboratory site. "Oppenheimer and other top scientists cooperated with us," former KGB official Yuri Kolesnikov told reporter Michael Chapman of  Human Events . They weren't Soviet agents, Kolesnikov said. But they "gave us information about the atom bomb," first because they were fearful that Hitler might defeat the Soviet Union in World War II and later because "Oppenheimer and the other scientists wanted to create a balance of power between the United States, which had the bomb, and the USSR, which didn't." [267]  "Oppenheimer was not a Soviet agent like Fuchs," the museum's director told Chapman. "But, yes, he did cooperate with Soviet intelligence. That's why his picture is here." [268]

According to Haynes and Klehr, "Throughout his life Oppenheimer declined to provide a detailed or accurate accounting of his relationship with the CPUSA in the late 1930s and early 1940s and of his knowledge of Communists who worked on the Manhattan Project." [269]
