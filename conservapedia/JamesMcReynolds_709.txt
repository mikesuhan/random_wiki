James McReynolds  was a  Supreme Court  Justice between 1914 and 1941.

He was born on February 3, 1862, in  Kentucky . He graduated from  Vanderbilt University  in  Nashville , then he studied  law  at the University of  Virginia .  After graduating in 1884, he went on to work for Howell Jackson, a Tennessee senator. Later he moved to  Washington D.C.  where he worked for the  Attorney General . He practiced law in New York, and in 1913, he was named Attorney General by  Woodrow Wilson .

According to President & Chief Justice William Howard Taft, Wilson was disappointed in the attitude of (McReynolds) (because) "Mr. Wilson is in favor of a latitudinarian construction of the Constitution of the United States to weaken the protection it should afford against socialistic raids upon property rights, with the direct and inevitable result of paralyzing the initiative  and enterprise of capital necessary to the real progress of all."

McReynolds was selected by Taft to write the Judiciary Act of 1925 (often called the "Judges Bill"), together with Justices Van deVanter and Sutherland.

McReynolds was also noted for his staunch anti-Semitism; he refused to speak to fellow justice  Benjamin Cardozo  and did not attend the swearing-in of  Felix Frankfurter .

He was one of the " Four Horsemen " who was willing to declare as unconstitutional the  liberal  programs of President  Franklin D. Roosevelt 's  New Deal . He was adamant about the policy of  laissez faire ; he believed the  Constitution  supported it.

McReynolds never married. He died on August 24, 1946.
