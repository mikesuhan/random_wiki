Chordata  is a  phylum  of  animals , named after their possession of a  notochord  at some point during their lives (embryonic, juvenile, or adult). Chordates have four other unifying characteristics, also possessed at some life stage: a dorsal  nerve  cord, an endostyle, a post-anal  tail , and  pharyngeal pouches . Many chordates have a  spinal column , and are therefore  vertebrates .

The phylum includes several  classes , the most well-known of which are vertebrates:

There are also several obscure non-vertebrate animals including the  acorn worm ,  lancelet  and  hagfish .

Other common features include a single  brain  and a zig-zag  muscle  structure in the  torso , although these are not unique to the chordates.

Scientists believe that the chordata are closest to the  arthropoda  (shelled, joint-legged animals such as  insects  and  crustaceans ),  echinodermata  (spiny-skinned animals such as  starfish  and  sea urchins ), and  annelida  (earthworms) in biology, due to common features such as  segmentation , which are not seen in other phyla such as the  mollusca  (molluscs) or  coelenterata  ( jellyfish  and  sea anemones ).
