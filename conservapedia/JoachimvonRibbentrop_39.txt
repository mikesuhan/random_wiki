Joachim von Ribbentrop  (1893-1946) was Foreign Minister of Germany during the  Second World War  and was hanged on 16 October 1946 after being convicted of  war crimes  by the  Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal .

Ribbentrop (who only adopted the aristocratic 'von' prefix to his surname in 1925) was born in Wesel, Prussia, and educated at a number of private schools in Germany and Switzerland before working for engineering companies and as a journalist in the  United States  and  Canada . He escaped Canada just before the outbreak of the  First World War  and served as an officer on the eastern and western fronts, being awarded the  Iron Cross . Following the war he worked for a  champagne  company, and only joined the  Nazi  Party in 1932, apparently for careerist rather than ideological reasons, though once a member he adopted extreme views (even by Nazi standards) and an outspoken  Anti-Semitism  which he had never previously voiced. From 1936 to 1938 Ribbentrop was German  ambassador  to the  United Kingdom , and from 1938 to 1945 was German Foreign Minister. In this role, he was partly responsible for the  Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact  of 1939, which led to the partition of  Poland  between Germany and the  USSR .
