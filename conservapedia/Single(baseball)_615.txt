In  baseball , a  single  is a play in which the batter safely makes it to first base.

Not all instances of a batter reaching first base are considered a single.
In order to qualify for a single the batter must have hit the ball and run to first base before being tagged  out  or the ball is thrown to the first baseman (or other defending player) who steps on or otherwise touches first base.
