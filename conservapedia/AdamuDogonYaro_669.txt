Adamu ,  (d. April 28, 1967)  as he was called, was a  Nigerian   missionary  who met his greatest success amongst his own Fulani people in Nigeria and Dahomey (now Benin).  He helped found a Fulani Bible School to train Christian workers for the nomadic Fulani people.

In his early life, Adamu was an  Islamic  malam, or teacher-leader.  Born in Bornu, the fifth son of his Muslim family, Adamu was encouraged to follow the tradition of dedicating his life to Allah, and the job suited him well.

Through friends who gave him a  New Testament , he began to search for truth and eventually came to faith in  Jesus Christ  not only as a prophet of Islam, but as the Savior who took our sins on Himself to provide salvation.

Adamu married a Christian woman, Jumai, and together they had five children.

Feeling a burden for the old walled city of Kano (within the modern city), Adamu and his family lived and witnessed there for eleven years, enduring great antagonism and open opposition in that Muslim fortress where there were no other known believers.  Later he traveled amongst the Fulani of his own Nigeria and neighboring Dahomey (now Benin).  With them, he met far greater success.

Later in his life he helped found Fulani Bible School, where he worked to train Christian workers for the nomadic Fulani people.

In his last year or so, he suffered from a throat condition, but ministered to the end, even in failing health.  He was buried at the Bible school.  His story was written by Eva Doerksen, SIM missionary who met him shortly after his conversion to Christ and who followed and was inspired by his life. [1]
