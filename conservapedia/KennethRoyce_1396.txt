A lifelong  hunter , Royce has written about Americans booking an African safari. Royce's experience there so far is: 3 countries, 4 safaris (one a 2x1) amongst 110 days in the field, 4 four  rifles / calibers , and 40 animals collected (a third of which were stalked to within 50 yds). "Hunting is, for me, a biological, emotional, and spiritual imperative. I truly do not have a choice in the matter--nor would I ever want one." [9]
