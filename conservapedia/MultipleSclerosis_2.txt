Multiple Sclerosis  (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system characterized by the destruction of the  myelin  sheath surrounding neurons, resulting in the formation of "plaques."

MS is a progressive and usually fluctuating disease with exacerbations (patients feeling worse) and remissions (patients feeling better) over many decades. Eventually, in most patients, remissions do not reach baseline levels and permanent disability and sometimes death occurs.

The cause of MS is unknown. The most widely held hypothesis is that MS occurs in patients with a genetic susceptibility and that some environmental factors "trigger" exacerbations.

MS is 3 times more common in women than men, with diagnosis usually made as young adults.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the  Hepatitis B vaccine  does not increase the risk of developing multiple sclerosis or other demyelinating diseases. Studies have also shown no evidence of a relationship between the Hepatitis B, influenza and tetanus vaccines and relapses in MS patients. [1]
