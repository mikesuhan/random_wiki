Lowell was born March 1, 1917, to a high-class family in Boston, Massachusetts, and claims many famous relatives including  Jonathan Edwards ,  Anne Hutchinson , and  Robert Livingston . [2]   As a young child, he had decided on a career as a poet, and studied the English poetry tradition each summer between studying at St. Mark's preparatory school.

[6]   He would continue to write in  Mills of the Kavanaughs , a series of monologues, though it was his 1959 poetic autobiography  Life Studies  that would establish the genre of confessional poetry for which he known for creating.
