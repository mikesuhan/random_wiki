Thomas Archibald Toley  (better known as Tommy Toley) is a well known cabaret performer and television personality in his native country of  Scotland . Born to a working-class family in the Cludgie district of  Glasgow , Thomas started his career performing alongside his father in the working men's clubs in Glasgow as a folk musician. Although not academically gifted, his talent shone through from an early age and his first television appearance was at the age of 12 on a family variety show where he played the ukulele to the popular folk song "Awaey Ye 'Bawbag".

A string of appearances followed on and, at the age of 21, he was given his own show on ST TV, "the Five Thirty Show". In his own words, it is "a return to the golden age of family entertainment" and features songs, cabaret performances, Scottish celebrities and on Sundays, a hymn and a Bible reading from one of the many Scottish churches the show visits.

Tommy is a lifelong Christian and sees his show as an extension of his faith and a return to simpler times when good family entertainment was the staple of broadcast television. He is a great believer in charity and has founded a mission in his native Glasgow which he funds entirely on his own. He attributes his own fortune to "God, his fellow Scots and a love of the Boaby"(the deceased Scottish preacher Robert Murray "Boaby" McCheyne, founder of the Scottish evangelical movement).
