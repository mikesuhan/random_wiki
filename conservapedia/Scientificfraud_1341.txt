Scientific fraud  has always been a problem. People claiming to have discovered something, when they know they really haven't, have fooled many people many times. (See  history of science ). Scientific fraud differs from  scientific error , since in the case of fraud the researcher  knows  his findings aren't actually supported by the available evidence.

The  global warming theory  is based on fraudulent statistics and outright misrepresentation or dismissal of known scientific facts. See  Climategate ,  Hockey stick graph , etc.

An American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) report defines scientific fraud as "including falsification, fabrications, selective use of
data, and manipulation of graphs and figures."  [1] 
Ironically, the AAAS is itself guilty of selective use of data and of censoring papers which contradict its  public policy  positions.
