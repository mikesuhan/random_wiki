Philip K. Dick  is a popular author of  Science Fiction  novels and short stories.  Dick was born on December 16, 1928 in  Chicago  and passed away on March 2, 1982 due to heart failure.  His books earned him several nominations for the  Hugo Award  and  Nebula Award , including winning the 1963 Hugo Award for  The Man in the High Castle  about an alternate future in which Germany and Japan had won World War II and divided the United States between them, Germany ruling the East Coast and Japan the West Coast.

Dick was an  atheist  who had a number of spiritual experiences, visions, and revelations, but attributed them to his drug use, or mental illness. He routinely asserted the weakness of faith, such as when he said, "reality is that which, when one stops believing in it, doesn't go away." Many of his stories involve intervention into human affairs by fantastic, space-dwelling deities.

In spite of his general left wing outlook, Dick was staunchly  pro-life , and wrote a story, "The Pre-Persons" in the wake of Roe v. Wade, in which Congress in a future USA rules that a child does not have a soul until he or she is able to perform algebra, and may be terminated at any time up to that.
