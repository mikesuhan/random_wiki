The  nervous system  is the set of  neurons  and support structures that process and organize information from the  senses  and bodily organs, analyze and coordinate appropriate responses and control the behavioral actions of an  organism . All anatomical structures of the nervous system are made up of  nervous tissue .

The nervous system is present in some form in all chordates with the simplest system represented in the  flatworms , which has two nerve cords running on opposite sides that connect to two simple  brains  called  ganglia .

In the more complex  vertebrates  the nervous system is divided into two parts: the  central nervous system , composed of the  brain  and the  spinal cord ; and the  peripheral nervous system , which is composed of all the nervous tissue throughout the rest of the body.
