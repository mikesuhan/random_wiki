Necrophilia , according to the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , 5th Edition, is listed under "Other Specified  Paraphiliac  Disorder", 302.89, which reads "Examples of presentations that can be specified using the 'other specified' designation include, but are not limited to, recurrent and intense  sexual arousal  involving ... necrophilia ( corpses )".

Practicing  Christianity  under this paraphilia is impossible, and being saved virtually impossible, for obvious reasons.
