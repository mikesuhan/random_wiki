Rhode Island  is the smallest U.S. state in land area (48 miles long by 37 miles wide [1] ) and one of the original thirteen colonies. Its area is 1,214 square miles, less than one-seventh the size of  New Jersey .

Its official name is actually "The State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations." [2]  So, even though it is the smallest state in the  United States , it has the longest name.

Providence , the capital of Rhode Island was founded by  Roger Williams . It was the first government in the world to be founded on the principles of religious liberty, and separation of church and state. This was very different from the situation in Boston, which was ruled by the  Puritan   theocracy .  Quakers , for example, were welcome in Rhode Island but not permitted in  Boston . For a while the Quakers controlled the colony of Rhode Island, and took an active part in  King Phillips War .
