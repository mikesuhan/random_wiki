George Butterworth , (1885-1816),  English  composer, was a keen collector of folk tunes and used the traditional music of the English countryside as his inspiration. He is well known for his settings (in two “cycles”) of eleven  of the poems from  A.E. Housman ’s “ A Shropshire Lad ” and two orchestral suites, “ Banks of Green Willow ”, and “ A Shropshire Lad - Rhapsody ”.

He had no chance to write more – he was killed in action on the  Somme  in 1916, aged 31.

One of the better known Houseman songs -  The lads in their hundreds .  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4kPNyQc5Ro   The words can be found at  Ludlow .
