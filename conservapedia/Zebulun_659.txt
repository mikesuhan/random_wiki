Zebulun  ( Hebrew :  זְבֻלוּן ,  Zəḇūlūn ; "gifts, honor"), (b. 2253 AM, or 1751 BC), was the sixth son of  Jacob  and  Leah . He is the ancestor of the Tribe of  Zebulun , one of the  Twelve Tribes of Israel . ( Genesis 30:20  )

In 2298 AM (1706 BC), Zebulun entered  Egypt  permanently, having visited Egypt twice before to buy grain during the famine of 2296-2302 AM (1708-1701 BC). He was 45 years old at the time and had three named sons:  Sered ,  Elon , and  Jahleel . ( Genesis 46:14  )

Zebulun will live by the seashore and become a haven for ships; his border will extend toward  Sidon .  Genesis 49:13

Zebulun appears in an undistinguished (and probably accurate) role in multiple  motion picture  and  television  projects depicting the life and career of  Joseph .
