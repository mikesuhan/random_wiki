Michael S. Dukakis  (born 1933) was a three-term  Massachusetts   governor , who ran for  President of the United States  in 1988 as a  Democrat . After obtaining the party's nomination, he lost to President  George H.W. Bush  mostly due to his soft on crime policies.  His running mate was Senator  Lloyd Bentsen  of Texas.

Dukakis is a US Army veteran, serving in South Korea from 1955 to 1957.

Dukakis was first elected Governor of Massachusetts in 1974. He was defeated in the 1978 Democratic primary by Edward J. King, but would return to defeat king in 1982 and be reelected Governor in 1986. He was Massachusetts' longest serving Governor.

Dukakis finished third in the Iowa caucuses, but went on to win the New Hampshire primary by a considerable margin. From this point forward he led the field in the all-important accrual of delegates and managed to outlast the other Democratic hopefuls.

Dukakis and Bentsen faced the GOP ticket of Vice President Bush and Senator  Dan Quayle  of Indiana. Dukakis' image and campaign were mortally wounded by his soft approach to crime as evidenced by the Willie Horton debacle. Horton, a convicted murderer, committed a violent rape and assault after being released from prison as part of a Dukakis-approved furlough program. Fueled by Bush strategist  Lee Atwater , the issue became a hot-button topic during the election.

Dukakis lost the election to Bush by a wide margin, winning only ten states.
