The Center For Bio-Ethical Reform  (CBR) was founded in July 1990 as a privately funded, non-profit educational corporation on matters of  abortion . They believe that until the  evil  of abortion is seen, it will never be understood. CBR displays some of the most graphic images of aborted children to shock the conscience and awaken the nation to the horrible injustice. Per their website,

CBR operates a number of different campaigns. The Reproductive "Choice" Campaign shows what a choice really looks like. The Genocide Awareness Project (GAP) is a traveling photo-mural exhibit. The Matthew 28:20 Project is an offshoot of the Genocide Awareness Project but is directed at the secular community with an appeal for  civil rights . The AbortionNO Campaign is an animated web presentation with the most sobering 1st trimester and 2nd trimester abortion images in existence.
