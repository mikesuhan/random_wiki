Federalist No. 78 , authored by  Alexander Hamilton  under the pen name  Publius , is the seventy-eighth of 85 essays.  Titled " The Judiciary Department  ", Hamilton explains that the federal judiciary should be the "least dangerous" of the three branches of the federal government as created by the  United States Constitution .

It was published on November 27, 1787.

As designed at the  Constitutional Convention , the judiciary was built to be least dangerous branch of government, notes Hamilton:

Unlike the President and Congress, judicial agents are not elected and thus are not representatives of the people. [1]

Like the  Constitutional Convention , Hamilton discusses the concept of  Judicial review  in Federalist 78.  He wrote:

This passage, like many others like it, make it clear that judicial review was something that the founders intended for the courts to possess.   Judicial supremacy , on the other hand, which involves the courts granting themselves the power to legislate from the bench, cannot be found in any of the writings of the Founding Fathers, nor can it be found in the court case  Marbury v. Madison .
