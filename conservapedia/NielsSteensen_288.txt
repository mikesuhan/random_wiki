Niels Steensen  or  Nicolaus Steno  (1639â€“86) was a Danish scientist and theologian who is famous for his significant breakthroughs in especially  anatomy  and  geology . He was the first to study the human  heart  scientifically and to discover that it is a  muscle , and he examined the human brain and criticized earlier descriptions of its parts and their functions.

In the field of geology, he formulated several pioneering theories relating to the study of  strata , i.e. layers in soil or rock, and described how such layers would form chronologically through sedimentation. He also studyed  fossils , in particular suggesting a theory that could describe the process of  fossilization  through chemical changes.

However, in the late 1660s, while studying in Florence, Niels Steensen converted from  Protestantism  to  Catholicism . While he continued to study and teach scientific subjects for some years, by the mid-1670s he had dedicated himself to fully to theology, becoming an important figure in the  Counter-Reformation . He was made  Bishop  of  Schwerin  in 1676, working to promote Catholicism in the predominantly Protestant Northern  Germany  until his death ten years later.

Niels Steensen was originally buried in the Basilica di San Lorenzo in  Florence , but his body was exhumed in 1953 and reburied in the "Capella Stenoniana" in the same basilica. He was beatified by the  Catholic Church  in 1987. As of 2008, his case for  canonization  is still being considered by the  Holy See .

"Niels Steensens Gymnaisum", the only Catholic high school in  Scandinavia , is named after him. The school is located in  Copenhagen , Denmark, and has close ties to the  Jesuit Order .
