Afterlife  is the existence that one has after physical death.  In the  Christian  religion, all humans were made with souls that live on after the body has expired.  Those souls will either be with  God  through the atoning sacrifice of  Jesus , or will be separated from Him, either in eternal torment as punishment for their sins as  Protestants  believe, or in a temporary place of cleansing called  purgatory , as the  Catholics  believe.
