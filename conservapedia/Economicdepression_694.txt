According to Investopedia, an  economic depression  is: "A severe and prolonged  recession  characterized by inefficient economic productivity, high unemployment and falling price levels. In times of depression, consumers' confidence and investments decrease, causing the economy to shut down. The classic example of this occurred in the 1930s, when the  Great Depression  shook the global economy." [1]
