The  Labarum  was the  Roman Emperor   Constantine 's  Christian  standard after his triumph at the  Milvian Bridge  in A.D. 312.

The standard consisted of a purple banner with the  Greek  slogan, "In this sign [of the Cross] you shall conquer."  It was suspended from a long and gilded spear, with a chi-rho symbol of  Christ  at the top.

Fifty soldiers guarded this standard.
