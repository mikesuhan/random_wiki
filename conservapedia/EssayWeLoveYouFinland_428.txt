According to the website traffic tracking company  Alexa  the second most popular country for Conservapedia readership is  Finland . [1]   According to Alexa as of October 5, 2008, an amazing 6.9% of Conservapedia's readership is from the country Finland ( United States  citizens are the biggest readers of Conservapedia which is not surprising since Conservapedia started in the USA and is currently only offered in the English language).

Considering that the  UK  has a high percentage of English speakers and that the  UK  has about 12 times the amount of the people of Finland, the fact that Alexa ranks the Finnish as the second highest percentage of Conservapedia readers is quite remarkable.  Alexa states that as of October 5, 2008, 5.2% of Conservapedia's readership is from the UK which makes citizens of the UK the third largest readership of Conservapedia.  [2]

I largely wrote three articles which have been viewed quite a bit at Conservapedia ( atheism ,  evolution , and  homosexuality ).   I also contributed quite a bit to Conservapedia's  Christian apologetics  and  Christian legal apologetics  articles.  So I want to thank the Finnish for telling their friends about Conservapedia.

I would like to end this essay by simply stating to Conservapedia's Finnish audience the following on behalf of my fellow Conservapedians:  We love you Finland!

For those people who have never heard the national anthem of Finland you can do so  HERE .
