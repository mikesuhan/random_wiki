The  Uniting and Strengthening America by Fulfilling Rights and Ensuring Effective Discipline Over Monitoring Act,  often known simply as the  USA Freedom Act,  is a law first introduced in Congress on October 29, 2013, after  Edward Snowden  leaked bulk collection of data on American citizens. It was passed into law on June 2, 2015, the day after key parts of the  Patriot Act  expired due to inaction in Congress on the renewal of the provisions. This law imposes restrictions on the  National Security Agency  on retrieving phone records involved in terrorist plots, requiring a warrant, and also requires a warrant to use roving wiretaps and the ability to track lone wolf terror suspects.
