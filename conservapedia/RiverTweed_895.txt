The  River Tweed  is a river of northern  Britain , which forms the border of  England  and  Scotland  for part of its length. It is 156 kilometres (97 miles) long and rises on Tweedsmuir in south-western Scotland, the moor being the watershed of the Tweed, Annan and  Clyde  river systems. Flowing northwards and then eastwards it passes through  Peebles ,  Melrose  and  Kelso . Shortly before  Coldstream , which lies on the north bank, the river becomes the Anglo-Scottish border for some 27Â km. A little way west of  Berwick upon Tweed , the river enters England for a few short miles; it flows into the  North Sea  at Berwick. It is a noted sporting river, particularly for its  salmon  fisheries. At Paxton, west of Berwick, it is crossed by the  Union Bridge , the oldest suspension bridge in Europe, and at Berwick by the Royal Border Bridge, a magnificent railway viaduct designed by  Robert Stephenson  (the name is misleading as the river does not form the border at this point). Several other handsome bridges span the river.

The woven woolen cloth known as 'tweed' has no connection with the river name, but is a corruption of 'tweel' ('twill').
