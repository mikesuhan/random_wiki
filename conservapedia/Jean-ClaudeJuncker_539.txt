Jean-Claude Juncker  (born December 9, 1954) was  prime minister  of  Luxembourg  from 1995 to 2013. He was a member of the  Christian Social People's Party , the largest political party in the country. A strong supporter of the  European Union , Juncker was elected president of the  European Commission  in July 2014 and assumed that office in November 2014.

Juncker was succeeded as prime minister by  Xavier Bettel .

In March 2017, Juncker indicated he would support the independence of U.S. states, in revenge of U.S. President  Donald Trump 's support for  Brexit â€”something which showed either Juncker's ignorance of the difference between the EU and the U.S., or his support for a "United States of Europe." [1]   Nigel Farage  called Juncker a "complete and total idiot" for those comments and that they cost him and the EU "whatever credibility it had in the USA." [2]

It was reported that Juncker took Brexit personally and, along with the other  European elites , planned on taking revenge against the UK in the exit negotiations. [3]
