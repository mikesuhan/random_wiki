Spiders  are a group of  arachnids  characterized by possessing eight legs and usually 6-8 eyes (depending on species), a fused  head  and thorax and a large abdomen. Both land and sea varieties are known, with many of the  sea spiders  being known for their spindly legs and often strange appearances. Spiders feed on small prey such as  insects , although some exotic varieties are blood-drinkers.

Some people have an  irrational fear  of spiders. This is called  Arachnophobia .
