Social services  are publicly funded and privately funded national, regional and local welfare agencies located and/or operating in city and neighborhood services centers and hospitals.

Also included are privately funded Catholic, Lutheran, and mainstream Evangelical Christian Social Services Centers established in cities throughout the entire United States and its territories, and throughout Europe and Africa, explicitly established and funded by church and private donations (often tax-deductible). Church donations dedicated and set aside for this ministry are regularly collected monthly and annually in what are often called  appeals , to minister to the needs of individuals and their families, frequently in coordinated efforts involving civil, state and federal relief agencies and care facilities.

Planned Parenthood  and other similar organizations present themselves and their facilities to the public as lawful social and health services centers which include offers to kill human beings before they are born as a "beneficial" service to women and their families. Many Christian denominations also explicitly support abortion services. The Protestant religious bodies which support the right to abortion, at least in some circumstances, include: Quakers (American Friends Service Committee); Lutheran Church in America; Presbyterian Church; Reorganized LDS; Unitarian Universalist; United Church of Christ; United Methodist Church; the Episcopal Church; the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and the Moravian Church in America. In the USA, from 1979 to 2003, Episcopalian, Lutheran, Presbyterian, Methodist and United Church of Christâ€”generally followed their churches' teachings, increasing their abortion-rights votes by 13 percentage points, from 62 percent to 75 percent.

Euthanasia  organizations, and individuals such as the notorious Dr.  Jack Kevorkian , likewise seek to offer  suicide  as a form of health care, to (eventually) be included among the many options offered to individuals by publicly funded social services. [2]
