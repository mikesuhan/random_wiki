The  Orthodox Christian Reformed Church  is a theologically conservative federation of  American   Reformed Churches  in the Dutch  Calvinist  tradition. These churches confess the  Bible  to be the Word of God and believe it is faithfully summarized by the  Three Forms of Unity .

The first Orthodox Christian Reformed Church congregation was organized in Listowel (now Wingham),  Ontario ,  Canada , in 1979 by families who had left the  Christian Reformed Church  for doctrinal reasons.
