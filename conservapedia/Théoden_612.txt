Théoden  is a character in  J. R. R. Tolkien 's  Middle-earth  world, appearing in  The Lord of the Rings . He is the King of  Rohan .

Théoden was the son of King Thengel and Morwen of  Lossarnach . He became the 17th King of Rohan. Théoden married Elfhild and had a son, Théodred. His youngest sister Théodwyn's children were  Éomer  and  Éowyn .

During the  War of the Ring , he fell under the sway of his advisor  Gríma , called by others Wormtongue and secretly in the service of the traitor  Saruman . Gandalf helped him to see the light, and strengthened, he played a major part in the war. He led his people in the  Battle of the  Hornburg , and in the Battle of the  Pelennor Fields , where he was killed. He was succeeded by his nephew Éomer.

Relations between Théoden and his nephew Éomer and niece Éowyn were notable. Each, in loving loyalty to their uncle and king, disobeyed him in ways which proved crucial to victory in the war. Éomer let Aragorn live, when blind obedience to the king's order would have forced Éomer to kill him along with the elf and dwarf who were his companions. Eowyn left Rohan in man's garb, riding to war with  Merry , and together they defeated the head  Ringwraith .
