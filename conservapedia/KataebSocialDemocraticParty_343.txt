The  Kataeb Social Democratic Party  is a  Lebanese   Christian  political party and  militia . The name Phalangists (Phalange and Phalange party are variations on the same) is both a translation from Arabic and a small distortion, coming from phalanx. The correct name would have been Lebanese Kataeb Social Democratic Party.

The politics of the Phalange party was pro-Western, and they opposed any pan-Arabism.
