Modesty  is one of the fruits of the  Holy Spirit . This refers to humility, the lack of pride and boastfulness.  This word can also refer to dressing oneself appropriately to avoid attracting improper sexual attention, although this is not the intended meaning of this word when referred to as a fruit of the spirit. [1]

The  Fruits of the Holy Spirit  are perfections that the  Holy Spirit  forms in us as the first fruits of eternal glory. The tradition of the Church lists twelve of them.

Modesty is also known as "demureness" and many women whose ethnic origin is from  Western Europe  or  Northern Europe  are usually depicted this way based on their typically soft features. Noteworthy examples of this in fairytales and other related media include Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, Little Red Riding Hood, Wendy Darling from  Peter Pan , Christine Daae from  The Phantom of the Opera , Ophelia from  Hamlet  and Dorothy Gale from  The Wizard of Oz . Swedish actresses such as Greta Garbo and Ingrid Bergman were also well-known for their soft features and demureness.
