Leo Szilard  invented the  atomic bomb . Szilard was born in  Budapest ,  Hungary , but claimed  German  citizenship.    Szilard knew  Boris Pregel , president of the Canadian  Radium  and  Uranium  Corporation before  World War II  when both lived in  Europe . Szilard came to the United States approximately 1940.

Szilard is the first known  person  to have the  idea  of a  nuclear   chain reaction . He had this moment of  insight  on September 12, 1933 as he was crossing the street in London. [1]  Such an event would release massive amounts of  energy . It convinced  Enrico Fermi ,  Einstein , and others that it is possible. Szilard received a US patent for it. He wrote a letter dated August 2, 1939 that he had Einstein sign to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt stating that a powerful new bomb could be created. This resulted in the  Manhattan Project . In 1945, after the Manhattan Project had made a successful atomic bomb, Szilard started a  petition , signed by a number of his fellow atomic  scientists , requesting that the bomb not be used against  Japan .

Szilard later worked on  molecular biology . In 1961, Szilard published a group of short stories entitled  The Voice of the Dolphins and Other Stories: And Other Stories  (part of a series called the Stanford Nuclear Age,  ISBN 0804717540 ). The title story presented the idea of an international biology research laboratory in Europe. In 1962, Victor F. Weisskopf,  James Watson  and John Kendrew met to plan the implementation the idea. This led to the European Molecular Biology Laboratory was founded in  Heidelberg  in 1974. It now has several satellite locations. [2]
