DuQu  is  computer   malware  classified as a Trojan Horse.  It is built with the same basic source code of  Stuxnet , so it has been concluded that this malware was designed and released by the same party responsible for Stuxnet.  Some are even referring to DuQu as Stuxnet 2.0. [1]   In general, this  Trojan Horse  was designed for intelligence gathering and espionage. [2]   There have been two versions of this malware released so farâ€”the latter was detected in June 2015. [3]

Duqu is often delivered as a  Microsoft   Word  document.  Once opened, it exploits what was at the time of release a  zero-day vulnerability  (that is, one which was completely unknown) in font handling.  Once a computer is infected, it opens a "back door" and begins downloading the main content of the malware.  It also has rootkit functionality, so it can run nearly invisibly on the host computer.
