The  Great Fear  ( French :  la Grande Peur ) occurred in July and August of 1789 in  France  at the start of the  French Revolution . Rumors spread among the peasantry that nobles had hired brigands to march on villages and destroy the peasants' new harvest. In response, peasants sacked the castles of the nobles and burned documentation recording feudal obligations. Most of France was eventually affected.  This event led to the abolition of  serfdom  and  feudal  obligations, and brought up the need for a new class structure.
