Oberammergau  is a town in  Bavaria ,  Germany , famous for its production of a  Passion Play  since 1634. The town and surrounding area had been struck by the  Black Death  ( bubonic plague ) in 1632, and the inhabitants vowed to God to perform the Passion Play every ten years if they were spared the worst ravages of the disease. The play is performed over a five-month period in the first year of each decade, and involves almost every inhabitant of the town in some way. Besides the Passion Play, since 1932 (with breaks during  World War II ), Oberammergau hosts a 'living' chess game, in which pieces are 'performed' by people.

The  anti-Semitic  nature of the play drew praise from  Adolf Hitler  and in more recent years has drawn criticism, particularly from the  Anti-Defamation League [1]  for its portrayal of  Jewish  characters. In response to the criticism, some changes were made before the 2000 production.
