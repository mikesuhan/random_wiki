What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?  (or  What to the Slave is the 4th of July? ) was an hour-long speech given by  Frederick Douglass  on July 5, 1852 in Rochester New York. [1]   According to historian James A. Colaiaco, "Douglass's oration would be the greatest abolition speech of the nineteenth century." [2]

The speech is widely taught in High school and college classes across the country. [3]   Andrew S. Bibby, a professor of American studies at Christopher Newport University, argues that the true meaning of the speech has been lost over time with parts of the speech being left out. [3]

The speech has been partially given under the title  The Meaning of July 4th for the Negro  by some very well known Hollywood actors, such as James Earl Jones, Morgan Freeman, Danny Glover.

One of the most frequently omitted parts of the speech is Douglass' assertion that the  United States Constitution  is a "GLORIOUS LIBERTY DOCUMENT".(Douglass capitalized this himself) [4]

About this "Glorious Liberty Document", Douglass argued that:

Douglass had a somewhat well-known break with the Garrisonian wing of the  Abolitionist movement , which included among other topics the Constitution. [5]   William Lloyd Garrison  was widely known to have believed that the Constitution was a "covenant with death" in regard to slavery. [6]   Douglass, being an avid lifelong reader, decided that he would take the time to go back and read the original sources.

Once he read the original sources, there was no way Douglass could stand by the Garrisonians any longer.  In  My Bondage and My Freedom , Douglass wrote:

Once Douglass read the actual history of the Constitution on his own, through his own original research and not limited to what others wanted him to read, he became a defender of the Constitution. [8]
