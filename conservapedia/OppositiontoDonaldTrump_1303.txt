Donald Trump   has faced massive opposition  from  liberals  and  RINO  Republicans alike.

Since announcing his presidential campaign on June 16, 2015, Donald Trump has faced massive opposition from  liberals  and  RINO  Republicans alike. According to one study, during the  2016 presidential election , 91% of the media coverage regarding Trump was negative and 96% of campaign contributions from the media went to his campaign opponent, leftist Democrat  Hillary Clinton .

Due to his promotion and support of conservative,  America First [2]  policies, President Trump faced massive opposition from the left and the  establishment , [3] [4]  including from within the government bureaucracy. [5] [6]  (The fact that members of the  Deep State  have grown visibly scared of reports stating such confirms this view; [7]  in May 2017, it was reported that 60% of  National Security Council  employees were Obama-Administration holdovers [8] ). The Trump Administration was the victim of numerous leaks of information, many of which threatened U.S. national security – it was reported in July 2017 that leaks occurred once a day on average, [9]  and Trump faced seven times more leaks than Obama or Bush II did. [10]  Even before being inaugurated, Democrats spoke about  impeaching and removing  Trump from the presidency. [11]  Even some local communities passed resolutions calling for the impeachment of President Trump. [12]  Some Democrats used profane language against Trump, such as the f-word [13]  and s-word. [14]  As a testament to the deep opposition and hatred towards him by the left-wing, at least 217 violent protestors were arrested in Washington D.C. on Inauguration Day. [15] [16]  Left-wingers  committed or advocated for many other acts of violence  against President Trump or his supporters. [17] [18] [19]  It was reported in early February 2017 that 12,000 tweets already had called for Trump's assassination. [20]  The mainstream media helped promote such violence. [21]  In addition to domestic opposition, President Trump, and by extension, the United States, was strongly opposed by non-Americans compared to the Obama Administration, despite a majority of non-Americans believing Trump to be a strong leader. [22]

Senate Democrats unduly delayed Trump's cabinet nominees at historic and unprecedented proportions [23] —by February 8, 2017, only  George Washington  had fewer cabinet nominees confirmed by this length of time into his presidency. [24]  Trump's last cabinet secretary was confirmed on April 27, 2017, [25]  and Trump's last cabinet-level member assumed office on May 15, 2017. [26]  It was reported in July 2017 that Senate Democrats had filibustered most of Trump's nominees – every filibuster ultimately failed, but they slowed down the confirmation process. [27]  The result of this was that by July 2017, the Senate had confirmed 23% of Trump's appointments compared to 69% for Obama at the same duration. [28]

As in the 2016 presidential election, the  mainstream media  strongly opposed Trump and wrote him off as a failure early in his presidency, despite his numerous accomplishments by that time. [29]  As evidence of this intense MSM opposition, a study published close to the 100th-day mark of Trump's presidency found that 89% of media coverage regarding Trump was negative. [30]  A similar study conducted by the Harvard Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy released in May 2017 found that 80% of the mainstream media coverage over Trump (including outlets such as  Fox News Channel  and  The Wall Street Journal ) was negative. [31]  Additionally, Trump was on track to become the most mocked president on late-night comedy TV in at least 25 years. [32]  The American public had the same perception – a Rasmussen poll found that 50% of Americans believed the media was biased against President Trump and that 4% believed the opposite. [33]  The mainstream media promoted  fake news  against President Trump, [34]  with notable examples including an unverified dossier by  BuzzFeed , [35]  two stories by the  The New York Times [36]  and CNN, [37]  respectively, debunked by former FBI Director  James Comey , and an eventually-retracted  CNN  article that attacked Trump and his allies over a Russia fund [38]  that was motivated by ratings [39]  and caused three CNN employees to resign. [40]

In addition to strong opposition from the  mainstream media , [30]  which consistently misrepresented him and his accomplishments, [41]  Trump received opposition from Democrats and the liberal-influenced courts. By the  first 100 days  of his presidency, congressional Democrats had already (unsuccessfully) filibustered Trump's supreme court nomination, instituted one of the longest and most extreme delays in cabinet confirmations in U.S. history, and initiated an investigation into alleged ties between the Trump campaign and  Russia . [42]  According to a poll taken around the 100th day of Trump's presidency, only 11% of Democrats believed that their party's opposition to Trump had yielded successful results for them. [43]  A July 2017 poll found that 52% of Americans thought the Democrats only stood against Trump, rather than something more, with 37% thinking the latter. [44]  The Democrats' poor performance in the special congressional elections held in the first half of 2017 illustrated their weakness and unsuccess in challenging President Trump. [45]  Liberal federal courts also blocked some of President Trump's executive orders regarding sanctuary cities and immigration. [46] [47]

When polling organizations measure public opinion of political figures, they ask questions to determine how many people have a favorable or an unfavorable opinion of the person.  In general, politicians get elected because prospective voters' favorable ratings exceed the unfavorable ratings.  A candidate's rating earns a boost from his nominating convention, and again during the transition between election day and taking office, as America tends to unite behind the winner.  Every President experiences a decline in opinion polls as voters are turned off by unpopular decisions.  Donald Trump is unusual because he was nationally well known before entering politics, and he has maintained a very high negative rating since his earliest opinion polls. [48]   The leading explanation for how Trump became President was that the Democratic candidate  Hillary Clinton  was even more unpopular with historically high negative ratings. [49]
