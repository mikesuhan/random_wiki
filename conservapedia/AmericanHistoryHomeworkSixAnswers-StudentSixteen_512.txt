1. Abraham Lincoln's first priority on becoming president was to hold the union together.

2. The 13,14 and 15 amendments of the constitution were all about the rights of citizens. These amendments were made so that wars like the civil war wouldn't happen.

3. My favorite military leader of the civil war was Stonewall Jackson I liked him because he was a good christian a smart leader and a brave man.

4. I would have handled the reconstruction better by accepting the south back into the union and respecting them for having fought bravely.

5. Lincoln being home schooled meant that he was an independent thinker and that he was modest.

6. The political cartoon is showing Lincoln having a bad dream the dream is of Lincoln being thrown out of office and McClellan becoming president it is also a joke of when Lincoln disguised himself on the train to Washington.

7. This cartoon shows the anger against illegal immigrants and it shows Columbia defending the immigrants.
