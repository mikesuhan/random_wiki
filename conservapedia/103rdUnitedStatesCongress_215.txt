The  103rd United States Congress  refers to the sessions of  Congress  from January 3, 1993 to January 3, 1995.  Tom Foley  retained the Speakership and many Democratic policies were put into force. Among these were the  Family Medical Leave Act , the  Brady Bill , and the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. This was the last Congress for 12 years that Democrats would retain a majority in the House, as dissatisfied voters elected a Republican majority in the  104th Congress .
