Albatrosses  are large  seabirds , normally found far out in the ocean.  They use their very long wings to glide just above the waves, occasionally catching  fish  and  squid . Albatrosses make their nests in large colonies on remote islands.

Scientists disagree about how many species of albatross exist; between thirteen and twenty-four have been proposed.

The albatross is well known for its role in  superstition . Albatrosses often follow ships, and were believed to be the souls of drowned sailors. It was considered to be bad luck to kill one. In  Samuel Taylor Coleridge 's epic poem  The Rime of the Ancient Mariner , the mariner of the title tells a tale of the grim consequences of killing one of the birds.

In 1959 the crew of the ship  Calpean Star , docked at  Liverpool , refused to continue their voyage after they blamed on-board accidents on an albatross in the cargo, which was being taken to a zoo.
