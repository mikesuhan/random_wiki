Goodness  can be defined as the state or quality of being  good ; defined by positive traits such as moral excellence;  honesty ;  kindness ;  generosity . Goodness is one of the fruits of the  Holy Spirit . It refers to the  virtue  of being good of  mind  and  spirit  that ethical people strive to attain.

The  Fruits of the Holy Spirit  are perfections that the Holy Spirit forms in us as the first fruits of eternal glory. The tradition of the Church lists twelve of them, while  Galatians 5:22-23  (KJV) lists nine.

The Fruit of the Spirit is … goodness. In the Greek this word means benevolence, active good. Goodness is character energized, expressing itself in benevolence, active good. Different from an attitude like kindness, goodness is active … action.  Candy Troutman (Inspirational Speaker).
