Speech codes  are restrictions on  speech . They are often imposed by institutions on their members (such as corporate employers on their employees or universities on their students and staff) or by governments on their citizens. Some speech codes are more restrictive than others.

-- The Phyllis Schlafly Report, December 1996

In recent years, Speech Codes have also been implemented in major North American colleges and universities;  For example, Northeastern University in Boston's  Appropriate Use of Computer and Network Resources Policy [1]  prohibits students from using the university's information systems or facilities to send any message that “in the sole judgment of the University” is “intolerant” or “offensive.”  And Colorado State University’s  Residence Hall Handbook [2]  bans "[E]xpressions of hostility against a person or property because of a person’s race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, ability, age, gender, socio-economic status, ethnicity, or sexual orientation".

Various organizations such as the  Foundation for Individual Rights in Education  (or  FIRE ) have been established to oppose such trend. [3]
