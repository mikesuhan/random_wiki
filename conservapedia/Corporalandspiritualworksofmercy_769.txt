Corporal and spiritual works of mercy  are acts performed for the benefit of other persons as an expression of the  virtue  of charity. They are a requirement of the Christian worship of God ( Matthew 25:31-46   1 John 3:17-22 ).

The classic enumeration of them is seven corporal (physical) works of mercy and seven spiritual (social, non-corporal) works of mercy. [1]

In accordance with an ancient tradition over 2,000 years old, since before the time of Christ, and to the present day, devout Jews offer prayers for their dead:  Prayer for the Soul of the Departed - Kel Maleh Rachamim. [2]  See  Kaddish .

In the Bible see  2 Maccabees 12:41-45   Matthew 12:31-32   1 Corinthians 3:14-15   2 Timothy 1:15-18 .  See also  2 Timothy 1:18  multiple versions with commentaries  and  additional commentaries .

See  Purgatory . (See also  Apocrypha .)

Protestant Christian  doctrine mainly regards prayers for the dead as a harmful pagan  superstition  not found in the Bible, although  Lutheran  theology does not ban the practice. [5]

Tzedakah : The performance of good works of merciful charity is a demand of Judaism and a central tenet of Jewish life, also called  mitzvot  (singular,  mitzvah , commandments). [8]
