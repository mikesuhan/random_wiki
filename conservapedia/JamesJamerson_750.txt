James Lee Jamerson  (January 29, 1936 - August 2, 1983) was an influential American bass guitarist.  As a member of The Funk Brothers, he played on numerous Motown records throughout the 1960s and 70s.  He remained largely uncredited for his early contributions, which was typical at the time for studio musicians.  Jameson developed a unique up-front bass style consisting of syncopation and improvisation that was relatively unheard of at the time.  He is widely considered to be one of the greatest and most influential bassists of all time, though he gained little recognition in his lifetime.

Stand out tracks include "Darling Dear" by The Jackson 5, "What's Going On" by  Marvin Gaye , and "Bernadette" by Four Tops.
