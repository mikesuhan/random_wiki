Masih ad-Dajjal  is a Jewish personal figure in  Islam  known as the one eyed  Antichrist . His appearance will coincide with the arrival of the  Mahdi , the future savior of Islam who will reign for 7 years and convert the world to Islam.

The Dajjal, according to  Muslim  holy writings, will perform miraculous signs to deceive Muslims. The Dajjal will be successful until the return of Isa (Jesus). Isa will then execute the Dajjal, and the world will then enter an era of peace.
