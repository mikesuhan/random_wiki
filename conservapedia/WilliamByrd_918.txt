William Byrd  (1543-1623),  English   composer , was one of the last and perhaps greatest of the great  Tudor  and  Jacobean  masters that formed the musical component of the  English Renaissance .

He was a pupil of  Thomas Tallis , was appointed organist and choirmaster at  Lincoln  Cathedral in 1563, joined the Chapel Royal in 1570 and, with Tallis, was given a royal monopoly of music printing. (He was to publish three sets of his own songs to English texts.)

Whilst brought up in a  Protestant  household, he increasingly leaned towards  Catholicism , and much of his finest music is set to  Latin  texts – his music for the mass is the equal of any on the Continent. Whilst much of his catholic music is of a melancholy nature – he equated the state of catholic England with the fall of  Jerusalem  – he also wrote joyful consort and keyboard pieces that can be called exuberant.
