The  Battle of Kursk  in 1943 was the largest  tank  battle in  history .  It was between the  German   Wehrmacht  and the  Soviet   Red Army . German forces attempted to encircle Soviet forces in the Kursk Salient on the eastern front, but strong Soviet resistance defeated the German assault. Kursk was the last German offensive of any strategic significance in the east; henceforth, they would conduct a fighting retreat. Germany already suffered from a grave shortage of war ressources, when Hitler ordered the offenssive and lost a huge amount of tanks such as the new  Tigertank  and the  Panther .
