In  Banks v. Dretke , 124 S. Ct. 1256 (2004), the  U.S. Supreme Court  reversed a denial of a petition for  habeas corpus  because the  defendants  suffered from the concealment of exculpatory  Brady material  and  perjured  testimony by government witnesses, and sought relief on that basis.

The Court reiterated its holding in  Kyles v. Whitley  that “the materiality standard for Brady claims is met when ‘the favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.’”  Id. at 1276 (quoting Kyles, 514 U.S. 419, 435 (1995)).  “‘A defendant need not demonstrate that after discounting the inculpatory evidence in light of the undisclosed evidence, there would not have been enough left to convict.’”  124 S. Ct. at 1276 (quoting Kyles, 514 U.S. at 434-435).

Justice  Ruth Bader Ginsburg  delivered the opinion of the court, joined by Justices  William Rehnquist ,  John Paul Stevens ,  Sandra Day O'Connor ,  Anthony Kennedy ,  David Souter , and  Stephen Breyer , and joined in part by justices  Antonin Scalia  and  Clarence Thomas .  Justice Thomas (joined by Justice Scalia) filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.
