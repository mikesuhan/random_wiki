Wikivoyage  is a project of the  Wikimedia Foundation  that seeks to create a worldwide travel guide. It was split of from Wikitravel after a continuous smear-campaign against the parent company of Wikitravel perpetrated by the atheist and liberal Wikimedia foundation. While it claims to have neither religious nor political bias, its articles on  Christianity , the  United States of America  and  apologism for Islam  show that it is just as biased as other projects of the Wikimedia Foundation, the parent company of Wikipedia. Maybe this is what happens when  a secular foundation takes over a well maintained advertising financed capitalist wiki.
