1.	The following six powers are clearly the most important of all the powers of Congress: Money Power, Citizenship Power, War Power, Intellectual Property Power, Postal Power, and Spending Power

2.	Preventing New Jersey from requiring homeschoolers to take public school exams annually is a provision added to the “No Child Left Behind” law. If homeschoolers were forced to take these exams, New Jersey would lose a huge amount of federal funding.

3.	Only one third of the entire Senate is elected every two years. The elections are staggered so that the Senate is more ‘stable’. If every position in the Senate was up for election every two years, the whole Senate would frequently be replaced, and it would be hard to make any progress on any long-term project.

4.	There are a few steps to creating a new law. First, a statute is drafted by a committee in the House of Representatives. Next, a hearing is held which is open to the public. Those of the public attending are permitted to testify for or against the proposed law. If the bill passes, their witness will become part of the legislative history of that law. Comments made by legislators will also become part of the legislative history, as well as when the bill is debated in Congress.

5.	A power that the federal government lacks is the power to interfere with affairs of the family.

6.	Textualism is the belief that only the text in the statute should describe the meaning of the proposed law, not legislative history. Legislative history should not be considered when interpreting the meaning of the law seeing as it is only someone’s recorded point of view regarding the bill or similar bills.

7.	There are many differences between the political systems of the United States and England. For example, in England, the leader is voted on by their legislative branch, parliament. In our country, the leader is voted on by the entire country.
