SWAT  is an  acronym  for  S pecial  W eapons  a nd  T actics, and is the term that describes a unit of a city  police  force or a county  sheriff 's department in the  United States  specially equipped and trained to deal with high-risk situations that would be too dangerous for patrol officers to deal with.

The nearest equivalents to SWAT in countries other than the United States are the national gendarmeries in various countries in  Europe , including the  French  Gendarmerie and the  Italian  carabinieri. The key difference is that SWAT is a specialized team of police officers or sheriff's deputies trained in  military   weapons  and  infantry  assault tactics, while still answerable to a local police chief or sheriff.  European  gendarmeries exist as separate national police forces. Whilst in  Australia  they have  Special Operations  Group and in  New Zealand  the Special Tactics Group. Both these units worked together during the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.

There is much discussion on the  Police state  level of militarization of the local  law enforcement  including "no knock raids" and automatic asset forfeiture without trial as part of the  War on Drugs  and the  War on Terror . The most well known of the many books on the subject of the overuse of the SWAT teams is from  Radley Balko , a policy analyst at the  Cato Institute , authored  Overkill: The Rise of Paramilitary Police Raids in America .
