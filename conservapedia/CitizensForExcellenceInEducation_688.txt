Citizens For Excellence In Education  (CEE) is a conservative religious organization dedicated to restoring classroom prayer and public school bible reading, banishing sex education, and stopping "the homosexual/lesbian invasion" in public education. It is headed by  Robert L. Simonds , who edits the organization's newsletter  Education Newsline  and records a weekly radio broadcast "Issues in Education" heard on over 70 Christian radio stations. Simonds has dismissed CEE's critics  National Education Association  and  American Civil Liberties Union  as "union goons" and "anti-Christian hate groups." [1]  The organization has led the charge against outcomes-based education, which is liberal in nature.
