Pienza  is a small town in the  Tuscany  Region, in northern  Italy . The town has 2,111 inhabitants (2015).

It was in this Tuscan town that  Renaissance  town-planning concepts were first put into practice after  Pope Pius II  decided, in 1459, to transform the look of his birthplace. He chose the architect Bernardo Rossellino, who applied the principles of his mentor, Leon Battista Alberti. This new vision of urban space was realized in the superb square known as Piazza Pio II and the buildings around it: the Piccolomini Palace, the Borgia Palace and the cathedral with its pure Renaissance exterior and an interior in the late  Gothic  style of south  German   churches .
