1. Now that you've taken the midterm exam, how might you have prepared better? (5 words or less)

Need. To. Start. Studying. Earlier.

SUBSTITUTE H2: Napoleon's Empire: write about any aspect of it that interests you.

Napoleon Bonaparte. The name of this great leader is a household item, and you would be hard pressed to find someone who does not recognize the name of this great French military genius. He had a lot of ambition and determination, and once he made a decision, he stuck to it. He was a brilliant commander, and gave many influential and memorable speeches.

3. The French Revolution: all bad, or was there something good about it?

There are many controversial issues about the French Revolution. In my opinion, the cause the people fought for was worthy, though the means by which they sought to achieve it were not.

4. Pick another revolution and describe it. 
The American Revolution was a turning point for the world. Different mind-sets and outlooks on life create different results, and by comparing the French Revolution and the American Revolution, this becomes evident. The American Revolution sought complete freedom for it's people, in the world that they could create.

5. Why do you think it took the world so long before revolutions started occurring?

The revolutions did not occur until the culture and society of the world had begun to crumble. Technology had allowed people to become too apathetic, and monarchs had become too greedy. These world powers were crumbling form the inside out, and it was up to their people to stop it.
