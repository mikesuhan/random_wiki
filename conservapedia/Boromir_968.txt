Boromir  is a human character in  J. R. R. Tolkien 's Middle-earth world, appearing in  The Lord of the Rings .

Boromir is the son and heir to  Steward Denethor II  of  Gondor , and older brother to  Faramir . He also was Captain of Gondor.

Though it is revealed during the introduction of Boromir that his intentions to use the  One Ring  for the purposes of power, it is later revealed that his father, Denethor II, had tasked him the quest of bringing the ring back to  Minas Tirith  before even setting out. Unfortunately, during the ambush at Amon Hen by  orcs , after Boromir subsequently tried (and failed) to entice  Frodo  to journey towards Minas Tirith, he was slain in battle. His  repentance  for the treachery of wanting the ring was to protect both  Merry  and  Pippin  to the death, being finally brought down by arrowfire.

In  Peter Jackson 's  film adaptations  of  The Lord of the Rings , Boromir is played by the actor  Sean Bean .
