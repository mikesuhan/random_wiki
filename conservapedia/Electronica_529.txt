Electronica  is an  umbrella term  for a wide range of  musical styles  which are either composed or manipulated using either  analog  or, more recently,  digital  technology.  The myriad sub-genres range from minimalist  ambient  soundscapes to fast, distorted, percussion-dependent compositions.

Electronica as a genre became widespread in the 1980s due to the increased availability of electronic instruments. Prior to companies such as Yamaha and Roland mass manufacturing affordable  synthesizers  and  Drum Machines , these were incredibly expensive items limited to the already wealthy, for example the popular  French  composer, Jean-Michel Jarre.

Early examples of the genre include New Order and Gary Numan, who draw influence from  New wave . More recent acts that could be described as electronica are Moby, Fischerspooner, and The Chemical Brothers.
