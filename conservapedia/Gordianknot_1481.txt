A  Gordian knot  (GOR-dee-un NAHT) is a problem apparently unsolvable due to its complexity and has its history in ancient  Greece .  A mythical peasant named Gordius became king of Gordium in  Phrygia .  He dedicated his wagon to his god and tied it to a beam with an intricate knot.  Later,  Alexander the Great  discovered the knot as he was undertaking his campaign against  Persia .  Legend said that the man who could solve the Gordian knot would go on to conquer all of  Asia .  Alexander solved the problem his own way, by using his sword to cut through the knot.  He then went on to conquer Asia.
