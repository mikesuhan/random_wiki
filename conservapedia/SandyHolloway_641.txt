Sandra LeBlanc Holloway , known as  Sandy Holloway  (born January 1954), [1]  is an educational administrator from Thibodaux in Lafourche Parish in south  Louisiana , who is also a  Republican  member of the eleven-person statewide Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education for District 3, which includes all or portions of fifteen southern parishes: Ascension, Assumption, Iberia, Iberville, Jefferson, Lafourche, Plaquemines, Pointe Coupee, St. Bernard, St. John the Baptist, St. Landry, St. Martin, St. Mary, Terrebonne, and Vermilion. [2]

Holloway was born in Breaux Bridge to Ivan and Bunice Montet LeBlanc. [3]  She received a  Bachelor of Arts  in elementary and special education from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, when the institution was known as the University of Southwestern Louisiana. She subsequently obtained graduate credits from Nicholls State University in Thibodaux, where she still resides with her husband, [4]  Skipper J. "Skip" Holloway, an  architect  there with Gossen Holloway & Associates. [5]  They have three children, Shay, Seth, and Semonne Holloway. [3]  She and her husband are active in Rotary International. [6] 
For more than two decades, Holloway was a classroom teacher and assistant principal at South Thibodaux Elementary School. Thereafter, she was assistant principal and then principal of St. Charles Elementary School, also in Thibodaux. She is a former supervisor of data and program evaluation for the Lafourche Parish School Board. In 2010, she was named director of the Bayou Community Academy, a  charter school  in Thibodaux. [3] [7]  At the academy, she worked with other schools to develop effective curriculum. [8]

Unlike opponent Beebe, Holloway supports the  Common Core  State Standards Initiative. [9]  On October 15, 2015,  The Baton Rouge Advocate  reported that PAC-Empower Louisiana had allocated about $818,000 to the BESE races in support of candidates who endorse Common Core. The  political action committee  members include Alice and Jim Walton,  Wal-Mart  heirs who reside in Bentonville,  Arkansas , Eli Broad of  Los Angeles ,  California , and the trade association, the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry in  Baton Rouge . Four candidates in eight districts, including Holloway and James Garvey in District 1 ( suburban   New Orleans ), were declared "acceptable" to the PAC. Holloway collected $87,696 from the group; Garvey, the board vice president who was reelected in the primary, received $230,459;  Holly Boffy , another incumbent, received $107,145. [10]

In the primary held on October 24, 2015, Holloway unseated the one-term Republican incumbent, Lottie Beebe of Breaux Bridge, the superintendent of schools in St. Martin Parish. An intraparty critic of departing  Governor   Bobby Jindal  and state Superintendent John C. White, [11]  Beebe cast the lone vote on BESE in 2012 against White's confirmation. [12] 
Holloway polled 74,078 votes (61.4 percent) to Beebe's 46,605 (38.6 percent). [2]  Most Common Core opponents were defeated for their reelection bids in the primary or in the case of Mary Johnson Harris of  Shreveport  forced into a runoff contest. [12] [13]

Holloway is a member of the Lafourche Parish Republican Women. [4]  An educator of thirty-seven years, Holloway said in her BESE campaign: "I'm just getting started. I've taught and overseen the teaching of thousands of students. I understand that our children are worth fighting for. ... I'm a firm believer in school choice. At the end of the day, what matters most is that all children have access to a quality education that prepares them for college, career, and life." [8]
