Zilpah  ( Hebrew :  זִלְפָּה ,  Zilpāh ; "drooping") was the maidservant of  Leah  and was given to  Jacob  to have children through her after Leah had stopped having sons as was the custom in the ancient mideast at that time. Zilpah had two offspring through Jacob,  Gad  and  Asher  both named by Leah.  They were Jacob's seventh and eight sons respectively. ( Genesis  30:9 - 30:12)
