Theodor Adorno  (Frankfurt am Main, Germany, 1903 â€“ Visp, Switzerland, 1969) was a German social psychologist who belonged to the left-wing ' Frankfurt School ' of critical theorists. Members of The Frankfurt School were principally Marxist.

Adorno was one of the most important philosophers and social critics in  Germany  after  World War II . He also wrote the book  Reflections From a Damaged Life , which inferred that coercion of logic can be broken through from dialectic thought.
