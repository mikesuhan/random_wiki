A mass  mailing  is the use of the  U.S. Postal Mail  to engage in grassroots lobbying or solicit customers or members.

Beginning in the late 1970s, mailings became a crucial element in the rise in the influence of  conservatives .  The traditional  media  became increasingly  liberal , but  conservatives  who tended to stay at home and read their mail were reached through mass mailings.
