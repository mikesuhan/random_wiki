A  functional group  is any one of a number of specific combinations of  molecules  within an  atom . Used mainly in  organic chemistry , functional groups are a helpful way to determine the structure and function of a molecule, as functional groups act very similar no matter what molecule they are a part of. [1]

A generic functional group is represented by the letter R in a  chemical formula . For instance, CR 4  represents a carbon with four of the same functional group bonded to it.

Some functional groups are described in the following table: [1]
