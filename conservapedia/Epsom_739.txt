Epsom  is a commuter town in  Surrey , south-east  England , located just outside the boundary of  London . It was notable as a  spa  in the eighteenth century, and the influx of fashionable visitors to 'take the waters' encouraged other leisure activities, notably horse racing. Epsom is still a major racing centre, and  The Derby , which began in 1780 and takes place at Epsom each June, is the most prestigious  flat race  in the  United Kingdom .
