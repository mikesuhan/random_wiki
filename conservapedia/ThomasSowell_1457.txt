Thomas Sowell  (born June 30, 1930) is  America 's most famous African American  conservative  author. His book  A Conflict of Visions  contrasts the political beliefs of the modern left and right. [1]  Sowell has a Ph.D in  Economics  from  Harvard University , and is currently a Senior Fellow at  Stanford University 's Hoover Institution. [2]

Sowell, who cites  George Will  as a personal influence, prefers writing for popular audiences over writing for more "academic" setting, saying that "writing for the general public enables him to address the heart of issues without the smoke and mirrors that so often accompany academic writing". [3]

Sowell wrote a well-researched book criticizing " black redneck culture " [4]  in which he points out that, "some blacks resent anything that suggests anything negative about themselves." [5]
