In  grammar , an  article  is a  morpheme , such as an  affix , which determines the scope of the described  noun . Use of a  definite  or  indefinite article  indicates that the noun to which the article refers identifies a  specific  referent identified previously, whether  explicitly  or  implicitly  (in which case the article is a definite article) or that it does not (an indefinite article).  Some languages, such as  Russian , lack articles.

The English definite article is  the , and the two indefinite articles are  a  and  an . "A" is used before words beginning with a  consonant , "an" before words beginning with a  vowel .  This distinction is  phonological  â€” based on the following word as pronounced, not as written; compare,  e.g. , "an honor" with "a union".

Also considered articles are English words like "some" (a  partitive  article) or "no" (a  negative  article), although this usage is less common in everyday language, where "article" usually means a definite or indefinite article.
