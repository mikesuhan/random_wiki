Draco  was an  Athenian  judge living around the 7th century B.C., to whom is attributed the first written code of Athenian law.  His laws were so strict that the term "Draconian" is still used to describe overly rigid rules, and yet, it transformed Athens into the premiere city state in  Greece  for hundreds of years.

It is unclear how much he created the laws as much as just put in writing what was already orally passed on.  There is also some question as to whether or not he was a real individual, or a legend to describe how the laws came to be.
