No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened.

Twelve amendments were originally proposed on September 25, 1789. Ten of those were ratified as the Bill of Rights, but this proposed amendment remained unratified until 1992.  No one has challenged whether the delay of over 200 years was too long a period for ratification to occur.  Most modern amendments have, written into the bill, a time limit on ratification.

Seven states had ratified this amendment by 1792, and the remaining states did not ratify until  Ohio  voted on May 6, 1873 as a protest to the  1873 "Salary Grab Act".  On March 6, 1978,  Wyoming  voted to ratify it as a protest to a Congressional pay raise.  The proposed amendment remained largely forgotten until  Gregory Watson , a University of Texas undergraduate, wrote a paper on the subject in 1982. [1]  Watson then spent years campaigning with state legislatures to secure the necessary additional states to ratify the amendment.  The  Congressional Apportionment Amendment  (the other amendment that was left unratified from the Bill of Rights) is still pending and can be enacted if sufficient other states approve it.
