In  Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Stiffel Co. , 376 U.S. 225, 231 (1964), the  U.S. Supreme Court  ruled that it is obvious that a State could not "extend the life of a patent beyond its expiration date."

Justice  Hugo Black , who was generally opposed to most patent rights, wrote the opinion for a unanimous Court.
