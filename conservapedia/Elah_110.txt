Elah  ( Aramaic  for  God ) (r. 930-929 BC by  James Ussher , [1]  or 886-885 BC by  Thiele [2] ) was the fourth king of the  Northern Kingdom  of  Israel . [3]  He reigned for two years. His reign was remarkable only for how it ended.

His father was  Baasha , and his death fulfilled a baleful prophecy given  Baasha  toward the end of his reign. His general,  Zimri , surprised him while he was intoxicating himself in the home of his steward, Arza. Zimri killed him, took his throne, and killed all his relatives and associates. Sounds nice and friendly, in a biblical sense
