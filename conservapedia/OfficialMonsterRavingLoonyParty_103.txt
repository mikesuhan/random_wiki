The   Official Monster Raving Loony Party  is a registered political party in the  United Kingdom , and was founded in 1983 by the late British "rock and roll" performer "Screaming Lord Sutch" (real name "David Sutch", 1940 - 1999).

Despite its apparent comical nature, because of the nature of British voting - where the candidate with most votes wins regardless of other considerations, the party has often been influential in close by-elections, though never coming close to taking a seat themselves, and indeed, rarely retaining their deposit. At the Bootle by-election in May 1990, the Loony candidate did receive more votes than the candidate for the  Social Democrats , however, much to the shock of the Loonies and the embarrassment of the Social Democrats. The party is currently lead by Alan "Howling Laud" Hope, and it's headquarters are located in  Holmfirth , West  Yorkshire  (better known for long running  BBC  sitcom " Last of the Summer Wine ").

People will often vote for the Monster Raving Loony party as a 'protest vote', either disagreeing with the electoral system, or to express displeasure at the 'main' candidates available to choose from.
