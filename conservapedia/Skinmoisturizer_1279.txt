Moisturizers , also known as  emollients  are complex mixtures of chemical agents specifically formulated to make the external layers of the  skin  ( epidermis ) softer and more pliable. They increase  hydration  of the skin by reducing  evaporation . Naturally occurring skin  lipids  and  sterols , as well as artificial or natural oils,  humectants ,  lubricants , etc., may be part of the composition of commercial skin moisturizers. They usually are available as commercial products for  cosmetic  and  therapeutic  uses, but can also be made at home using common pharmacy ingredients. [1]
