The " Dark Ages " is a term used for the time period lasting roughly from AD 450 to 1000.  They were the early part of the  European   Middle Ages . â€ŽIn  False Conflict: Christianity Is Not Only Compatible with  Science --It Created It,   Rodney Stark  writes:

Few written documents and buildings of this time remain. From this it has been concluded that little was accomplished culturally or academically. However, how much was actually achieved, but was destroyed during the migration of nations and was not readily rediscovered.

The "Dark Ages" has also been explained as a period of spiritual darkness when the light of true  Christianity  was nearly snuffed out by the persecution and killing of millions of Christians and withholding of biblical truth by organized "religions" which had more of a base in paganism than in biblical teachings. [1]

However, this is a false perception of the period. The so-called "Dark Ages" was also the period when Christianity spread through much of Europe, bringing enlightenment, knowledge and science. New monasteries were established which were the universities of their day, centres of science, learning, medicine and law, able to communicate with each other by well-developed networks, and capable of diffusing knowledge with remarkable efficiency. The life of the polymath scholar monk  Bede  is just one example of the intellectual revolution wrought by the spread of Christianity. Bede lived at  Jarrow  in  Northumbria  (modern-day north-east  England ); he was a theologian, historian and scientist, writing and researching prolifically and communicating with scholars across Europe.
