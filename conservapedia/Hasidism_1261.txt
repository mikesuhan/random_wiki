Hasidism  is a  Haredi  (ultra-orthodox) branch of  Orthodox Judaism  founded in the late 18th century in Poland. It is characterized by a dynasty of  rabbis  ("Rebbe" in  Yiddish ) who have lead the specific Hasidic movement from their home region of Eastern Europe, as well as a strict observation of the  Torah  and  Talmud .

There are many divisions which originate from Poland, Galicia (now divided between Poland and  Ukraine ), and  Russia , only differing slightly in some key ideological beliefs, but still keep all the characteristics of Hasidism. Some Hasidic dynasties include Chabad-Lubavitch, Zidichov, Tosh, Satmar, and Munkacs.

Hasidic Jewish men are immediately recognizable by their long side curls, beards,  fedoras , and black clothing. They also have large families, which also partly account for the fast growth of  Orthodox Judaism  in  America . Most Hasidic Jews live in  New York City , in the Crown Heights, Borough Park and Williamsburg neighborhoods of  Brooklyn , and in neighboring towns like Monsey and Kiryas Joel, an almost-entirely Hasidic Jewish village. There are also Hasidic populations in other major American cities. Outside of America, most Hasidic Jews live in  Jerusalem .

Their main language is  Yiddish , though in America they speak  English  as well. In  Israel , they speak  Hebrew  as their everyday language, though some Hasidim oppose the use of Hebrew as an everyday language and speak Yiddish instead.
