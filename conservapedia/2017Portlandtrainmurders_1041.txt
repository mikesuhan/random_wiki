On May 26, 2017, Jeremy Christian, a disturbed homeless man, stabbed three men, killing two, on a mass transit train in  Portland, Oregon . According to media reports, Christian made anti- Muslim  remarks to two teenage girls who appeared to be Muslim. Reports also say that he made other "anti-everything" and "anti-religious" remarks. The three men were stabbed as they attempted to defend the girls. [1]

The left-wing media was quick to label Christian as "racist," "right-wing," "Islamophobic" and a "white separatist," despite the fact that his Facebook posts painted a very different picture, showing him to be left-wing in his opinions, such as supporting atheism, marijuana use, and opposing controversial oil pipelines, and to hate all "monotheists," including Jews and Christians, and to be anti-racist. [Citation Needed]   He was also vehemently opposed to Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, religion, the state of Israel, and circumcision, the sort of conflicting ideology often found in morally misled terrorists. [2]   He stated that what he did was "patriotism," and within free speech guidelines. [3]

He also claimed on Facebook to have voted for  Bernie Sanders , whom praised for possibly being an atheist or agnostic and his favorable views on marijuana legislation, and supported  Jill Stein  in the  2016 presidential election , was rejected by Trump voters at events, and held many other left-wing positions.
