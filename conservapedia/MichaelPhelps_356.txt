Phelps set four individual world records and won seven gold medals at the 2007 World Championships to become the most successful athlete in World Championship history. By winning 6 medals (4 gold, 2 silver) in the 2012 Olympics, Phelps became the individual with the most medals won in Olympic events, with 22 (18 gold, 2 silver, 2 bronze), although this is only partly due to his greatness and dedication, and partly due to the disproportionate number of medals awarded for often only marginally different swimming events.  He has announced that he will retire after the 2012 Olympics in London. [2]
