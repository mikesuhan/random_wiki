Eos  was the rosy-fingered  Titan -goddess of the dawn in ancient  Greek mythology . She was one of the second-generation Titans along with her brother  Helios  and sister  Selene ; the  children of  Hyperion  and  Theia . Eos had an unquenchable desire for handsome young men, her lovers including Orion, Phaethon, Kephalos and  Tithonos , the first three of which she ravished away to far-away lands. Tithonos was a  Trojan  prince who became her official consort, but when Eos goddess asked  Zeus  for his immortality, she forgot to request eternal youth for him and eventually he shrivelled up and transformed into a grasshopper.
