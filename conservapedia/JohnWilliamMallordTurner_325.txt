best known as  Joseph Mallord William Turner

John William Mallord Turner  (1775-1851) was one of  England 's most famous  artists , who revolutionised the use of  watercolors . he first exhibited at the  Royal Academy  in 1791. He studied under  Thomas Girtin  and was also influenced by Dutch marine painting. By 1797 he had moved from watercolour to  oil painting , exhibiting a picture of  Millbank  at the RA, but his next major work, the  Romantic   Calais Pier  (1803), was strongly criticised as appearing unfinished. From this point in his life he was attacked by such figures as Sir George Beaumont, at that time the leading decider of artistic taste, but was also defended by the  portraitist  Sir  Thomas Lawrence . He travelled frequently to  Italy  and developed his oil painting style to more closely resemble his light-filled watercolours.

In 1843 he was championed by  John Ruskinin  the first volume of  Modern Painters , and his reputation as one of England's greatest artists has been sustained ever since.

He died in 1851, leaving 300 paintings and nearly 20,000 watercolours to the nation in his will.
