The Golden Horde  was a  Mongol  empire that ruled much of Western  Russia  in the 13th and 14th centuries.

When  Genghis Khan  died in 1227, the empire he built was divided among his sons and grandsons.  The western portion went to his grandson,  Batu .  Batu then invaded the  Crimea  and Kievan Russia, conquering it.  His armies then invaded  Poland  and  Hungary , and were successfully siegeing  Vienna , when the news came of the death of Ogedei, son of Genghis Khan, and grand ruler of the Mongols.  Batu abandoned the siege and went back to Mongolia to participate in the funeral and succession.
