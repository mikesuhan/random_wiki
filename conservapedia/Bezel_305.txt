A  bezel  is a metallic  rim  which sets or encapsulates jewelry and ornaments, either as a mild protective barrier or allowing attachments to loose  gemstones . It is one of the earliest forms of setting gemstones into jewelry. Easily worked by hand or with a small amount of pressure (using a  bezel roller ), the bezel is thin strips usually consisting of  silver ,  brass ,  gold , and other soft, pliable metals, the purpose of which can be manipulated with the least amount of effort and also appreciate the item's overall value. Some gemstones, such as  diamonds , need no protection with bezel setting, but rather the setting protects surfaces that the diamond may scratch or damage, as opposed to  prong setting  which exposes the gemstone.

Bezel wire  is a single piece of  wire  that has a much smaller width, and must be stacked or coiled in order to achieve the same purpose as a strip. This gives more options of preference to the wire shape, such as rounded or circular, squared, serrated, or flat-rounded (circular, with a flattened side). The individual wires, though more time-consuming and difficult, give the jeweler more artistic freedom. The advantage of using wires than strips is avoiding the use of  solder  to join the ends, instead wrapping one length of wire around another to create a  coil .

Bezel setting  has been associated mostly with  jewelry , though it can be applied to almost any object.  Cabochon  stones are primarily used for bezel setting, their shape having a flat surface that a back-plate can be soldered onto the bezel, securing while  faceted  stones require grooves into the bezel metal itself.
