In  Freudian psychoanalysis ,  super-ego  is one of the three primary constructs composing the human  mind . It was put forth by  Sigmund Freud .  Technically, the ego is the entity which is considered to be comprised of societal restrictions and taboos, and exerts its control over the  id , the primal desires of the mind, via the  ego . The super-ego is considered to be a father-figure of sorts, and considered to be created during the recession of the  Oedipus complex  in  psychosexual development .

Although much of Freud's theory is considered to be outmoded by modern  psychologists  and doctors, [1]  the entities which he suggested have become somewhat engrained in modern society, and are frequently invoked by laymen to be able to gain a better, though superficial, understanding of the psychoanalytical conceptualization of the human mind.
