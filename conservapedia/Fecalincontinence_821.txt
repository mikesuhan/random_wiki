Fecal incontinence  is a medical condition in which one looses control of one's bowels. Medical research shows that fecal incontinence, like many other diseases, is particularly common among homosexual men. [1] [2]

In the Spring of 2011, students at liberal  Rice University  premiered a musical called Cougar High which glorified  homosexuality  and exhibited an almost fetishistic obsession with fecal incontinence and related disorders. The musical included disgusting descriptions of fecal incontinence, and songs intended to mock conservative educators. [3]  Cougar High was praised by reviewers at the university for making a "satire of public education and the discrimination faced by homosexuals." [4]
