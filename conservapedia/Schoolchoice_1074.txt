The  school choice  movement seeks to improve education [1]  
by allowing parents the right to choose alternatives to  public school  for their children. Vouchers that enable parents to take their tax money and spend it on educational alternatives are often advocated to achieve this.
It was initially championed by economist  Milton Friedman  and his wife Rose in the late 1960s.

As of 2007, school choice is available only in very limited ways and only to a tiny percentage of the population.   Wisconsin  and  Ohio  have had very small programs.  Florida  has a voucher program and also has an online alternative to brick and mortar public school, known as Florida Virtual School.

In addition to  vouchers  for  private school  and  homeschooling  options, some states offer a choice, for those who choose the public school system, in which public school their children will attend. This is sometimes called  open enrollment .  School districts in  Florida  have an open enrollment system although traditional  dictatorship  still applies to the  school bus  system, and those who choose to attend a school where buses are unavailable are required to find alternate transportation. In regions where open enrollment does not exist in public schools, a  communist  style dictatorship determines what school public school students will attend, which can be particularly a problem where homeschooling is prohibited or unfeasible and no good private schools exist or are affordable.

A  Washington Times  editorial explains:

Betsy DeVos, Donald Trump's intended choice for Secretary of Education, has called the school choice movement an attempt to “empower” parents to find good schools for their children, whether they be traditional public schools in other neighborhoods, charter schools, virtual schools or private institutions.
