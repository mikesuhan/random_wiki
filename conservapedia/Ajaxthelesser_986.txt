Ajax the Lesser  was a son of Oileus, a Greek chieftain who fought for the Greeks during the  Trojan War . He was named Ajax the Lesser to differentiate him from the more well known and powerful  Ajax  the Greater, a son of Telamon. In the Trojan War, Ajax the Lesser was known for his speed and skill with a spear. He was also known for his arrogance and boastfulness. According to Greek mythology, the gods drowned Ajax after the war because he offended them during the sack of  Troy  by attacking  Cassandra , daughter of  Priam  the Trojan king, in the temple of  Athena .
