Katie O'Malley  is a freelance writer for a variety of publications, including Human Events Online.  O'Malley follows political, cultural and social issues. She has been active in politics since her youth when she "came out of the political closet" in an overwhelming  liberal  family.

O'Malley hails from  Chicago , and is the granddaughter of Congressman Thomas D. O'Malley (D-WI), best known for his pioneering work on behalf of Native Americans.  Her father, the Hon. Terence T. O'Malley, Sr. and uncle Thomas D. O'Malley were deeply involved in  Florida  politics though, like her grandfather, from the other side of the political aisle.  It was in this politically charged atmosphere that she learned the art of debate and honed her conservative beliefs.

In addition to freelance writing and participation in a variety of conservative causes, O'Malley works as successful non-profit fundraiser in the New York area.  O'Malley is the mother of two daughters, a son and four step-daughters.
