National Public Radio  (NPR) is a not-for-profit organization which produces and broadcasts various  radio  programs including news, talk shows, and entertainment.  The audience of NPR listeners has grown exponentially since the organization's inception in 1970.  Currently, NPR reports that 26 million  Americans  tune in each week. [1]   Not only does NPR boast a large weekly audience, it also produces the two most listened-to radio programs on public radio:  Morning Edition  and  All Things Considered .  A November 2005 poll claimed NPR to be the most trusted radio-broadcast news network in the  United States . [2]

NPR, along with  PBS , has been accused of tailoring its broadcasts toward a liberal point of view, making it little different than the  mainstream media  it claims to compete against.  According to NPR, "NPR supports its operations through a combination of membership dues and programming fees from over 860 independent radio stations, sponsorship from private foundations and corporations, and revenue from the sales  of transcripts, books, CDs, and merchandise. A very small percentage -- between one percent to two percent of NPR's annual budget -- comes from competitive grants sought by NPR from federally funded organizations, such as the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, National Science Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts."
