The  Cuban Revolution  was the movement led by the former lawyer,  Fidel Castro  to remove the dictatorship government of  Fulgencio Batista , and establish a new dictatorship led by Castro himself. The Revolution was fought for two years in the hills of Cuba by a broad coalition of the Cuban people.

It was only after Castro rose to power when he declared himself a  Communist  and unveiled his plan for a  Soviet -like state for  Cuba . Many of his former followers fled to the  United States  and organized there a resistance against the newly established  Marxist  dictatorship.

Among the most famous people who fought this revolution is  Argentinean  doctor and adventurer  Che Guevara .
