According to Christian doctrine, the  Savior  is the being, descendant of Eve, prophesied in Genesis 3:15 to execute justice upon the serpent ( Satan ) for tempting  Eve  to fall from  grace .  God said,  "And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel."   This prophesy was fulfilled in the person of  Jesus Christ , who was born of woman ("her seed"), endured suffering under sinful men ("thou shalt bruise his heel") but vanquished the serpent once and for all though his victory at the cross ("it shall bruise thy head").
