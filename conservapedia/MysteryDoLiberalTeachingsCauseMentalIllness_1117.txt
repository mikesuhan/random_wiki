The above-cited countries are notable for imposing  liberal  or  atheistic  teachings by their governments on large populations.  In the  United States , liberal indoctrination governs  public schools , which educate 89% of children.  As of 2002, "[a]n estimated 20 percent of children have a mental illness that causes at least mild functional impairment," [2]  with nearly all those children a product of a  public school  education.

Public schools  educate 89% of Americans, and "[t]he incidence that a teen will have depression some time in their adolescence is higher, felt to be at least one out of four. [3]

Japan  has the largest  atheistic  population of any country in the world. [5]   The former Soviet states have rates of  atheism  that are among the highest in the world. [6]

Britain , a smaller country but one that also has heavy  liberal  indoctrination, expects a 61% increase in dementia cases by 2026, and "[i]n the last 10 years, funding for mental health services has risen sharply." [7]

Actor Stephen Fry is the author of the book "The Liar" and was an active supporter of the  liberal   British   Labour Party , though he did not vote for it in a recent election because it was not  leftist  enough on the  Iraq War .  "The 49-year-old actor has been tormented by mental illness for much of his life." [12]  Specifically he is a sufferer of bipolar disorder, a largely hereditary disease.

Professor  David Foster Wallace was a prodigy in writing, math and even tennis in his youth but adopted the  liberal  ideology.  He wrote in 1999 a collection of short stories entitled, "Brief Interviews With Hideous Men," in which he "damns his gender as a greedy, cold, oversexed marauders." [13]   In 2008, Wallace killed himself at age 46.
