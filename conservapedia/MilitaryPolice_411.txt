Military police  are members of the armed services who are responsible for the enforcement of military law on military personnel. Their routine tasks include patrolling military bases and garrison towns to provide a police presence, investigating crimes on military property or where military personnel are suspected to be involved and carrying out crime-prevention training in the military community.

Other tasks, especially in operational areas, may include the protection of high-ranking officers (such as the Royal Military Police's CP teams,) traffic control and establishing a police presence in occupied territory.
