The  Super Nintendo Entertainment System  ( SNES ,  Super NES  or  Super Nintendo  for short), known as the  Super Famicom  in  Japan , and the  Super Comboy  in  South Korea  is a 16-bit  video game  console first released in 1991 by  Nintendo . It was the successor to the company's  Nintendo Entertainment System  and predecessor to the  Nintendo 64 . Although the hardware is extremely similar, each have a regional lockout chip to prevent a console from one region from playing games from another. The SNES was the best-selling console of the 16-bit era of video games, despite having a late start against its main competitor, the  Sega Genesis .
