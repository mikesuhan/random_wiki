Steampunk  is a subgenre of  science fiction , usually set in the  Victorian  era, and featuring high-tech devices made using 19th century technology, often steam-powered. These stories almost always take place in an "alternate history", one of the most common being a history where  Charles Babbage  actually managed to finish his clockwork computer, the  Analytical Engine  (which, if it had been built during Babbage's time, would have been a computer with all the capabilities of later modern computers, albeit with much less processing power). The subgenre originated in the early 1980s and 1990s. The term steampunk seems to be a variant of cyberpunk.

Steampunk may also refer to an aesthetic style based upon the premise of Victorian steam and clockwork technology having become more advanced. At special events, steampunk enthusiasts often wear Victorian era clothing, modified with items like cogs or gears, goggles being another popular accessory in steampunk fashion. Many individuals also modify items such as computer keyboards to give them the appearance of an imaginary 19th century keyboards, plating them in ornately carved brass and replacing the keys with replicas of 19th century typewriter keys.
