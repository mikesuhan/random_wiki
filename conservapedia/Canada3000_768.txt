Canada 3000  was a discount charter airline headquartered in  Toronto ,  Ontario . It offered domestic and international flights. It was the largest charter airline in the world at the time of its operation, with over 90 destinations worldwide, although it changed to scheduled service in 2000 after the  Canadian Airlines  and  Air Canada  merger. Canada 3000 competed with Air Canada,  WestJet , and fellow charter airline Air Transat. In November 2001, the airline went out of business after a sharp decline in revenues following the September 11th 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States. There have been several attempts to restart the airline since then.

Many blame Air Canada for Canada 3000's demise as Air Canada received government funding in times of crisis, but Canada 3000, Canada's Second Largest Airline, did not.  Canada 3000 had a fleet of 68 aircraft, including the  Airbus  A310, Airbus A319, Airbus A320, Airbus A330, Airbus A340,  Boeing  737, and Boeing 757.
