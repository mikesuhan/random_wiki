Google Chrome  is a  web browser  developed by  Google  and based on the same WebKit layout engine that  Apple Inc. 's  Safari  browser uses, specifically, it uses the open-source code of the  Chromium browser . Three types of Chrome browsers are available for download; Chrome stable, Chrome Beta and Chrome Developer edition.

This Chrome browser is not to be confused with  Chrome OS , also by  Google , or the  open-source   Chromium browser , which is the basis of Chrome.

There is some concern that this browser tracks activity and reports it to  Google , much as  Google 's online services and  Android  system do. [4]   To protect their privacy, some people choose alternatives like the  SRWare Iron  browser instead, since it uses the same engine but offers better privacy.

Google works with one or more dictatorships to censor search results, so that only what the government wants their citizens to see comes up.  Also, they have been caught filtering results in the U.S. and other countries, often to artificially promote their own websites [5] [6]  but also to match with their political and economic agenda.  
For these reasons, some people avoid using Google Chrome to avoid giving them further support.
