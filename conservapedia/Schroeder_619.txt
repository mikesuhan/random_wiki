Schroeder  is a fictional character in the  Peanuts  comic strip.  His one great love is playing his toy piano, which actually sounds more like a grand piano and his skills able to match any maestro instead of being those of a child.  He is an admirer of  Ludwig van Beethoven  and often plays his music.   Lucy  has a crush on him, but he is not interested in her.  A common theme is her getting upset at him spurning her overtures of interest and her pulling the piano out from under him causing him to flip in the air and fall on the ground.  After  Linus  and  Snoopy , Schroeder is one of Charlie Brown's best friends, even standing up for him to berate Lucy and her friends for their selfishness for not giving him any valentines for  Valentine's Day , then turning around and giving him a used valentine out of pity the following day to make up for their guilt (as seen in the strip and in the 1975 TV special  Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown ).
