The  Frisian Islands  are an  archipelago  off the coast of north-west  Europe , in the  North Sea . The Frisian Islands are part of the Wadden Islands and lie off the coasts of the  Netherlands ,  Germany , and are divided between those two nations.

The islands are also notable for their language,  Frisian  (which has several dialects), which is still spoken by several thousand residents. The Frisian language is generally considered to be etymologically the closest surviving relative of  English .
