A  scarecrow  is a man-shaped device used by  farmers  to scare away birds and stop them from eating their crops.  Most scarecrows are made from old clothes stuffed with straw. Famous scarecrows include Worzil Gummidge and the Scarecrow from the  Wizard of Oz . Some villages in  England  hold scarecrow competitions in which local villagers compete for the prize of most handsome scarecrow. The scarecrow competition in the village of  Slepe  is particularly popular in  Dorset .
