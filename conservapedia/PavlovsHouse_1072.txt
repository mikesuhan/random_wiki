In September 1942, during the  Battle of Stalingrad  a platoon of  Soviet  troops under Sgt. Yakov Pavlov captured an important apartment building.  For the next 59 days they held the building against overwhelming attacks by  German  troops.  It is claimed that the Germans lost more troops attacking this building than they did during the capture of  Paris  in 1940.
