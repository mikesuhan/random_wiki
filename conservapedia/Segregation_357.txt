Segregation  means to separate groups of people based on race or cultural differences. Segregation can be forced or self-imposed.

In the southern  United States , the policy was created by state governments at the end of  Reconstruction  in 1876 and the reemergence of  Democrat Party  control of Southern state legislatures. The Democrat Party has been known as the party of segregation ever since.

Woodrow Wilson , the second Democrat president after the  Civil War , introduced segregation into the United States government  Civil Service , requiring separate bathrooms and cafeterias in federal buildings and installations throughout the land, including Northern and Western states which had fought for the Union and existed without laws requiring segregation of the races. US  military  training and units also were segregated.

Segregation was allowed in public schools by the  U.S. Supreme Court  in  Plessy v. Ferguson  (1896), but then reversed after 20 years of Democrat control of both Houses of Congress and the presidency when  President Eisenhower  appointed former California Republican Gov.  Earl Warren  as Chief Justice. The  Warren Court  ordered school desegregation in  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954). As a reaction in the 1960s, Democrats "wanted policies that privileged whites."

In addition to the public schools, segregation existed in the United States military up until 1947.  In the Democrat-controlled  South  and  federal government  it existed in public accommodations like restrooms, drinking fountains, cafeterias, movie theaters, buses, trains, sports arenas and hotels before the federal government reversed itself and banned it with the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .

Ann Coulter  wrote, "There was more desegregation of American public schools in Nixon's first term than in any historical period before or since."  [1]
