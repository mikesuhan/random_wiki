Analysis  is the branch of  mathematics  concerned particularly with the concepts of function and limit.  The subject has its origins in the quest to put  calculus  on a rigorous footing, and it is to this end that concepts like  continuous  and  limit  were first defined rigorously by  Karl Weierstrass  and  Augustin-Louis Cauchy .  Weierstrass gave the now-familiar "epsilon-delta" definition of a limit and worked to elaborate its basic properties.  He demonstrated, for example, that there exist functions which are continuous functions which are not differentiable at any point.  The possibility of such pathological functions could not have been imagined by  Isaac Newton  and others who had worked on calculus with less formal underpinnings.

Since its origins in the calculus, analysis has expanded into a vast subject with applications to every other branch of mathematics.  It now includes other familiar topics like  Riemann integration  and  Lebesgue integration , picking up entire fields like measure theory along the way.  Analysis also plays an important role in  applied mathematics , where it provides the machinery which make methods like  Fourier analysis  possible, and many deep results about solutions of  differential equations  may be proved by analytic methods.  Besides these well-known subjects, there are numerous other subfields of analysis dealing with more specialized subjects:

In addition to these branches, there are other less familiar branches of analysis, including  p-adic  and  non-standard  analysis.
