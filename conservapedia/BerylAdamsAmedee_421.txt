Amedée is one of the seventeen Louisiana House Republicans who openly sided with Attorney General  Jeff Landry  in blocking an executive order by  Governor John Bel Edwards  which until it was declared unconstiutional would have protected homosexuals from discrimination in the workplace. She also opposes a state Senate bill which would require all employers but religious institutions to hire regardless of sexual orientation. The Senate bill, she said, places greater restrictions and burdens on businesses beyond what federal law requires and is a threat to religious freedom. Amedée said she opposes governmental intrusion into the employment process but reached out to homosexuals, saying, "People don’t want to understand today that if I disagree with you, that doesn’t mean that I hate you.” [5]
