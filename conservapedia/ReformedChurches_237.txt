The  Reformed Churches  are a group of  Protestant  Churches that originated during the  Protestant Reformation  of the 16th century. This Protestant movement was led first by  Ulrich Zwingli  and then by  John Calvin . "Reformed" churches are said to be  Calvinist  in doctrine.

The Reformer,  John Calvin , was French by birth; however he wrote and preached mostly in Switzerland. Here he published his "Institutes of the Christian Religion". From Geneva, Calvinism spread throughout Europe, but especially into the  Netherlands  and  Scotland . Various Confessions were drawn up to distinguish the Reformed faith from other Protestant viewpoints. English  Puritans  and Scottish  Presbyterians  brought the Reformed faith to the United States and Australasia after the Reformation. So did the Reformed Dutch and Germans and the French  Huguenots  bring their faith to South Africa.

In Reformed Churches, the Bible is the sole and supreme authority in all matters of faith. The various Confessions are merely accepted explanations of Biblical doctrine.

The Confessions:

Reformed Churches use the  Presbyterian polity  for their church government. This emphasizes the autonomy of the local church, which is governed by  elders .

Scottish Presbyterian, and Dutch and Swiss Reformed churches are distinguished by different confessions, but hold to the same set of beliefs.

Another tradition has developed also--"Reformed Baptist." It shares some of the same Calvinist beliefs as the general Reformed Churches, but Reformed Baptists baptize adults and not infants as other Reformed Churches do. They adhere to the  London Baptist Confession .

Here is a brief summary of the Reformed Churches in the Western world. Liberal denominations are distinguished from the more Conservative ones. "Conservative-Fundamentalist and Orthodox" denominations include a wide spectrum, however, and may range from moderately conservative to very Orthodox.
