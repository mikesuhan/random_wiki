Some of the news articles posted on the Main page need new articles created on Conservapedia. If you create a wanted page for a news article, it will be wikilinked on the Main Page.

This table is a count of  completed  wanted pages per contributor. This table lists only those contributors with 10 or more pages completed and is updated when the completed pages are archived.  
For the full list, see the  Wanted page - Completed archives  page.

These wanted articles were taken from the  Conservapedia wanted articles  list. Completing these wanted articles adds to your total count.

Whenever this section contains over 25 entries, the first 25 entries are added to the  Wanted page - Completed archives  page so this section doesn't get too large in relation to the page.
