A  Mouse model  is a laboratory mouse useful for medical research because it has specific characteristics that resemble a human disease or disorder. Breeds of mice having natural mutations similar to human ones may serve as models of such conditions. Scientists can also create mouse models by transferring new  genes  into mice or by inactivating certain existing genes in them.
