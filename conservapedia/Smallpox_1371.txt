Smallpox  is an acute, highly infectious, and sometimes fatal  disease  caused by a poxvirus and characterized by high fever and aches with subsequent widespread eruption of pimples that blister, produce pus, and form pockmarks. It is also called variola. [1]

Susceptibility to smallpox is based to a large degree on ethnic heritage.   Europeans  were plagued by it for many years and built up a resistance, whereas native  American  populations were decimated when European explorers reached the Americas, almost causing extinction in many areas.

Smallpox was eradicated through a mass vaccination program undertaken by the World Health Organization, and the last known case of smallpox occurred in 1977.  It is tacitly acknowledged that the  United States  and  Russia  each have stores of the otherwise eradicated virus.  It is not known if other rogue states, such as  North Korea , may also have stores.  Because of the relative danger of the vaccine, and the eradication of the illness through vaccination programs, it is not felt that vaccination should be resumed, despite the possibility of the virus's use as a  bioweapon .  First responders are sometimes vaccinated.
