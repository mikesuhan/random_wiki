The  Tryzub  (trident, pronounced "treh-zoob") is the official coat of arms of  Ukraine .  It comes from the  Kyivan Rus ’, and it was the coat of arms of the Riurykide dynasty.  It was first found in Ukraine in the 1st century  AD . It was most likely a symbol of power of the earliest Ukrainian tribes.  Prince  Volodymyr the Great  (980–1015) put the symbols on coins.  Eventually, the Tryzub was replaced as the state emblem by Saint  Michael the Archangel  in the 12th century.

In 1918, the  Ukrainian National Republic  (UNR) adopted it as their coat of arms.  On 19 February 1992, after the restoration of Ukraine's independence in 1991, the Supreme Council accepted the tryzub as part of the official state coat of arms.

Various versions of the tryzub are used by Ukrainian organizations: some use a tryzub with a cross on it and others use a tryzub with a sword in the middle.  Today the tryzub is worn as a symbol of national pride, and it is on the country's flag, postage stamps, and money.
