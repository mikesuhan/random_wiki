Gary Hart  (born 1936) (born Gary Warren Hartpence) was the front-runner for the  Democratic  presidential nomination in 1984, when  Walter Mondale  beat him by gaining endorsements from the key labor unions, and again in 1988 when he self-destructed.  Previously he served as a  Democratic   U.S. Senator  from  Colorado  (1975â€“1987). [1]

Gary Hart became a casualty of his own misbehavior in 1987, when he was the presumptive front-runner for the upcoming  Democratic  presidential nomination. Although Hart had sworn to his staff that he had given up womanizing, rumors still abounded.  The  Miami Herald , staked out his townhouse and reported that it witnessed an attractive woman enter his townhouse one evening without leaving. [2] [3]  This caused as much criticism of the  Miami Herald  as of Gary Hart. [4]  His career collapsed when photos of Hart with Donna Rice on a yacht were published by the  National Enquirer , and even Hart's wife refused to support him.

Michael Dukakis , eventually won the nomination but lost in the general election to George H.W. Bush.
