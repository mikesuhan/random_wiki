Scott Eckern  is the heroic American/Californian  Mormon  who was forced to resign from his artistic directorship of a Sacramento theatre (California Musical Theatre [CMT]), after he donated $1000 to the 2008  Yes on 8  campaign. Although CMT denies that Eckern's leaving had anything to do with his political position, stating “At no time does [CMT] involve itself in political issues or ever impinge on the rights of its employees to engage in political activities of their choice”, [1]  the refusal of powerful playwrights and musical composers like  Marc Shaiman  (known for  Hairspray ) to let their plays be performed at CMT is clear evidence to the contrary.
