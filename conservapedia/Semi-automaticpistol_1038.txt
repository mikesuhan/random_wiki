A  semi-automatic   pistol  (formerly termed an "automatic" as in  .45 ACP ) is a small,  hangun  that fires, un- chambers ,  ejects , and re-chambers a  round  of  ammunition  with every pull of the  trigger .

Semi-Automatic pistols are carried by most law enforcement officers. These  firearms  distinguish themselves from a typical 6 to 7 shot  revolver  through the use of a removable  magazine  (also called a "detachable mag") that has a higher magazine capacity (typically 15 to 17 rounds or more for a .9mm or .40 Smith and Wesson, and 13+ rounds for  .45 ACP ), that can be quickly reloaded allowing for a higher total rate of fire with fewer and faster reloads.

An " action " is the mechanism that moves the chamber with the  spent cartridge  out of the way, moves a fresh cartridge into place, and readies the gun to fire again.

Semi-automatic pistols tend to be available with a wider array of  safety  features than most other  firearms , especially in  progressive   police states / Nanny states  such as  California ,  New York ,  Massachusetts ,  Connecticut ,  New Jersey  and  Illinois  where liberal bureaucrat lawmakers make more  mala prohibitum  laws to  demonize  then criminalize ordinary law-abiding  gun owners  and then authorize  asset forfeiture  (theft) of  private property . California especially has a  California Department of Justice Roster of Handguns Certified for Sale , [1] [2]  that strictly limits what handguns are allowed for purchase to a small variety that are "authorized" by the state with dangerous required features such as " magazine disconnect safety " and useless require features such as  microstamping .
