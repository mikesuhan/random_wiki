This is intended as an article rebutting the points in the  Counterexamples to Relativity  article.  That article's talk page has proven to be less than satisfactory for this purpose, because it gets archived, and much of its material has degenerated into personal disputes.  We believe that the two sides of the issue are better handled in two articles—this one and  Counterexamples to Relativity , rather than a talk page.

Unlike most essay pages, anyone is welcome to contribute.  We ask that you abide by the usual guidelines—do not remove non-vandal, non-parody, non-libelous material without discussing it first on the talk page, or explaining after-the-fact for serious problems.

Unless someone can come up with a sensible example, we will not be posting further rebuttals.  The recent ones have been hideously pointless, and not worth replying to.  Many of them have cited articles that have  nothing to do with relativity .  Tides do not disprove relativity.  It's possible that, because of the rather famous nature of the "counterexamples" page (it is cited around the world, and has nearly 2 million web views), people are simply putting in parody, or trolling, or humor, or whatever, in an attempt to see their work on a world-famous page.
