The  raven  ( Corvus corax ) is a large,  black - feathered   bird  of the  crow  family  Corvidae . They are found widely throughout the northern hemisphere. Ravens feed primarily by scavenging on carrion (dead animals). This has lead to them representing  death  in  European  cultures, although to the  Tsimshian  and  Tlingit   Native Americans  tribes of  Washington State  (and probably many other tribes), the raven is the  Creator  god.

A raven is the subject of the  poem  "The Raven" by  Edgar Allen Poe .
