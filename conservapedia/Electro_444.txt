Electro  is  music  made entirely of electronically-generated sounds. Typically, composers will use  computers  in the creation of this music, although other types of electronic equipment such as  analog   synthesizers , which predate modern PCs are also used in electronic music. The BBC Radiophonic Workshop pionered Electro music during the 1950s and 60s, using magnetic tape splices and filtering to produce innovative and - at the time - uniquely-sounding music and sound effects for BBC productions.
