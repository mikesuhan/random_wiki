Danelaw  was the name, first given during the 11th century, to the part of  England  which had been subject to  Danish  rule following invasion and conquest in the late 9th century. King  Edgar  (ruled 959-975) recognised the traditional or customary laws of his subjects of Danish origin and this practice was still appearing in documents during the 12th century, which defined the area as all of eastern England between the  Thames  and the  Tees  The Danes left a permanent imprint on not only on legal and administrative practices but also on place names, language and culture.
