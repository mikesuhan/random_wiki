The  island  of  Reichenau  on  Lake Constance  preserves the traces of the  Benedictine   monastery , founded in 724, which exercised remarkable  spiritual , intellectual and artistic influence. The  churches  of St Mary and Marcus,  St Peter  and  St Paul , and St George, mainly built between the 9th and 11th centuries, provide a panorama of early medieval monastic  architecture  in  central Europe . Their wall paintings bear witness to impressive artistic activity. [1]
