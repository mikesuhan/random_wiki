A  price war  is a battle between competitors in business to undersell each other's prices, such that the prices fall for the consumers.  While this is good for the public, it can result in  deflation  if done on a large scale and can cause one of the competitors to go out of business.

A example of a price war in May 2017 is  Amazon  and  Wal-Mart  competing with other by lowering the threshold amount for free two-day shipping on online orders placed with them.
