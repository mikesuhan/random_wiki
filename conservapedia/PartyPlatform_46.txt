A  party platform  is a list of beliefs and ideas which a party promises to work towards and accomplish if elected. The platform positions generally reflect the political leanings of the party's base. For example,  Republicans  generally run with a low-tax platform; whereas  Democrats  generally run on a platform calling for increased taxes to pay for social programs.

Most Americans do not read party platforms before voting.

The individual issues that make up a platform are called  planks .
