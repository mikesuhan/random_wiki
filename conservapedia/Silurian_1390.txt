The  Silurian  is a  geological  period believed by secular paleontologists to be between 443 and 417 million years ago. [1]   The fossil record shows that water-based life forms during the Silurian period included coral reefs, jawless fish, and freshwater fish.  Land-based life included spiders and centipedes. [2]   Vascular plants  first appear in the fossil record during the Silurian period. [3]

Young earth creationist  scientists state that there are numerous lines of evidence pointing to a young Earth and that the old Earth  paradigm  is errant and has many  anomalies . (For details, see  Geologic system  and  Young Earth Creationism .)
