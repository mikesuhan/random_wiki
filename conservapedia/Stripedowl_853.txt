The  striped owl  ( Asio clamator ) is a species of  owl  of the family Strigidae, and found throughout much of Central and South America.

Striped owls are medium-sized, 11-14 inches in length, with a 26-inch wingspan, and weigh between 11-19 ounces, with females larger than males. The face bears a brownish-white facial disk with a black border, with a dark beak and brown eyes. Its back is brown with dark mottling and thick bars, while the underparts are lighter in color, broken by multiple dark vertical stripes.

Striped owls are found in a variety of habitats, such as woodland and tropical rain forests, flood areas, pastures, and fields; they are absent, however, from the central portion of the Amazon rain forest. It ranges sea level up to 5,000 feet in altitude.
