Montserrat  is a small  volcanic  island in the  Caribbean Sea , in the  Lesser Antilles .  It is a  British  Overseas Territory, and is around 10 miles long and 7 miles wide. It was named by  Columbus  on his 2nd voyage after a mountain in  Catalonia .

It has a population of around 5,000 people, having decreased because of a volcanic eruption in 1995 that destroyed the capital, Plymouth, and caused a lot of people to emigrate to Britain. The de facto capital is Brades, a village in north Montserrat. A lot of the people are of  Irish  heritage, giving the island its nickname of "The Emerald Isle of the Caribbean."
