Metanoia  is a  Greek  term used repeatedly in the  New Testament  to mean  repentance  or penance. It comes from the Greek words " Meta ", meaning after, beyond, or with, and " Noia ", meaning thought.

Metanoia  as a change of heart [1]  and mind is, together with turning away ( epistrephein ) from the dominion of  heathen   idolatry  or  Jewish   phariseeism , the part of  conversion , a hoped-for response to preaching  Gospel . [2]

According to Nazi resister Wilhelm Busch, when a person accepts  Jesus , a real revolution begins in his life. The man who accepts Jesus begins a completely new life, and  God  gives him his  Spirit  who changes one's desires and even the way of thinking and entire way of living. [3]
