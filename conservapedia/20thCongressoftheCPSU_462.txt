The  20th Congress  of the  Communist Party of the Soviet Union  was held during February 14 to February 26, 1956. It is known especially for  Nikita Khrushchev 's "On the Personality Cult and its Consequences", which denounced the personality cult regime and dictatorship of  Joseph Stalin .

Delegates at this Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union were given no advance warning of what to expect. Indeed, proceedings were opened by Khruschev's call for all to stand in memory of the Communist leaders who had died since the previous Congress, with Stalin being mentioned in the same breath as  Klement Gottwald . Hints of a new direction only came out gradually over the next ten days, which had the effect of leaving those present highly perplexed. The  Polish communist  leader  Boles≈Çaw Bierut  died in  Moscow  shortly after attending the 20th Congress.

The speech shocked delegates to the Congress, as it flew in the face of years of Soviet  propaganda , which had claimed that Stalin was a "wise, peaceful, and fair leader." After long deliberations, in a month the speech was reported to the general public, but the full text was published only in 1989. Not everyone was ready to accept Khrushchev new line.  Albanian  Communist leader Enver Hoxha, for instance, strongly condemned Khrushchev as "Marxist revisionist." [1]
