Australian Rules Football , sometimes called  Aussie Rules  or  AFL , is a sport which differs from most types of  football  in that it is played on an oval field instead of the usual rectangular field, as used by  rugby  and  soccer . As the name suggests, AFL is most popular in  Australia , although the sport does have a limited following in numerous other countries. At its highest level, the game is overseen by the Australian Football League (AFL), [1]  which gives its name to a national competition of Australia's top 18 teams.

Each Aussie Rules team consists of 18 players who remain on the field for the entirety of the game (with some interchange and injury times).  The aim of the game is to kick a ball, shaped somewhat like a rugby ball, through two upright posts at either end of the oval.  Each "goal" is worth six points.  A miss of a "goal" is called a "behind" and is worth one point.  If the ball is touched by any part of the body beyond the leg then one point is scored. A new rule was introduced in 2009, wherby if a team rushes the ball through the opposition's goals, the opposition is awarded a free kick directly in front of the goals. Previously, it had been registered as one point. This leads to score lines which indicate goals, points and totals such as 11.15 (81). The game consists of large kicks (often over 60 metres) and spectacular jumps [2]  to catch the ball, resulting in a free kick (called a mark).

Aussie Rules is one of  Australia's  most popular sports, especially AFL as a spectator sport.  The Grand Final can attract up to 100,000 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground [3]  each September. Australian rules football is the sport most attended by Australians; in 2006 2.5 million people had attended at least one Aussie Rules game in the preceding 12 months. [4]

The reigning premiers of the AFL are the Western Bulldogs.
