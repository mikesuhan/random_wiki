Despite initially trailing in the polls to frontrunner Blair Hull, [1]   Barack Obama  greatly benefited from what the  Chicago Tribune  called "the most inglorious campaign implosion in Illinois political history" [2]  when pressure from journalists and opposing candidates, just weeks before the election, forced the unsealing of Hull's messy divorce files. [3]  The files revealed Hull's ex-wife's accusations of verbal and physical abuse. [4]  Hull would afterwards criticize the media, stating, "As for the press, I will never read the newspaper the same way again." [2]  Obama would go on to win the Primary with 53% of the vote. [3]  Obama's unexpected victory led to him being termed a "rising star" by the media. [5]

Once again Obama found himself trailing to popular frontrunner Jack Ryan, and once again a candidate's campaign imploded thanks to media intervention. In an unprecedented move, the  Chicago Tribune  and local TV station WLS sued to force the unsealing of Ryan's divorce files, despite opposition from both Ryan and his wife, Jeri Ryan, who in the files accused Jack Ryan of trying to coerce her to perform sex acts in public. Though Ryan advisors told him he could still win if using a negative attack on Obama, Ryan refused:

Ryan then dropped out of the race (per request by the Illinois GOP [7] ), following which the Illinois GOP scrambled to find a replacement, leaving Obama uncontested for weeks to campaign and build up public support. On top of all this, Obama was selected to give the keynote speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention (July 27 [8] ), catapulting him into the national spotlight, and leading to further media publicity terming him a "rising star".

After a number of candidates including former Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka declined to run, [10]  the Illinois GOP finally settled on fiery Alan Keyes, a former Ambassador to the Economic and Social Counsel of the United Nations, [4]  with less than 3 months left before the November 2004 election. [11]  His sudden entrance into the state for the election was initially attacked in the press as "carpetbagging". [12] [13] [14]  Keyes repeatedly claimed his primary motivation for entering a race he had seemingly no chance of winning was his disgust at Obama's votes on the popular  Born Alive  bills. Keyes, from his first day of arriving in Illinois (August 9, 2004), [15]  accused Obama of having voted against bills mandating medical care for newborn children, and supporting "infanticide" (the term twice used in the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act [16] ) where hospitals left newborn infants to die like garbage. [17] [18]

Obama in a debate on October 13, 2004, defended himself against Keyes' accusations of infanticide, retorting,

However, Keyes' rhetoric, calling Obama's votes "the slaveholder's position" [15]  and saying "Jesus Christ would not vote for Obama" [21]  was widely ridiculed by the press. Keyes' unabashed criticism of homosexuality as "selfish hedonism" also led to his demonization in the press when he was asked by gay radio host Michelangelo Signorile if that made Mary Cheney one as well, and Keyes answered, "Of course she is. That goes by definition." [22]  Major publications then criticized him as having "lashed out", "trashed", and "attacked" Mary Cheney as a sinner. [14] [23] [24]  Keyes pointed out that he never brought up the subject, and was simply responding to the show's host, stating "You have intervened in order to try to personalize the discussion of an issue that I did not personalize. The people asking me the question did so and if that's inappropriate, blame the media. Don't blame me." [25] [26]

Obama would ultimately win the election, 70% to 27%. [27]
