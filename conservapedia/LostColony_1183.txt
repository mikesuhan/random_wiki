The  Lost Colony , or  Roanoke Colony , was the first  British   colony  established in  America  on  Roanoke Island ,  North Carolina  in the late sixteenth century.   Sir Walter Raleigh  was given a charter to establish this colony by  Elizabeth I .

In 1587, a group of colonists returned to  England  to acquire more supplies.  Upon their return to the colony in 1590, they found it abandoned, with no trace of the colonists.  The only clue was the word "Croatoan" carved into a tree, which happened to be the name of local tribe.  There is speculation that they were either killed off by this tribe, or assimilated into their villages for survival purposes.  To this day no one knows their fate, hence the name the Lost Colony.
