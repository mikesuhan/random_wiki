In chemistry, a  solution  is a term that refers to a mixture of one or more substances. The substance that is dissolved is called a  solute  and the substance that dissolves is called a  solvent . For example, sugar water is a solution where the sugar is the solute and the water is the solvent. Gases can also be a component in solutions, such as oxygen and water. Solutions are not limited to liquids, but mixed gases are referred to as mixtures rather than solutions.

Solution is also a common term that means the answer to a problem.
