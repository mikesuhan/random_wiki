Marshal  Semyon Konstantinovich Timoshenko  (1895-1970) was a senior  Soviet  military commander during the  Second World War .

Drafted into the Russian army in 1915, he joined the  Red Army  in 1918 and became a noted cavalry officer; during the  Russian Civil War  he also met and became a friend of  Stalin , which was to help protect him in subsequent decades. In early 1940 he was made commander of Soviet troops fighting  Finland , reversing the disastrous early Soviet conduct of that war and forcing the Finns to sue for peace in March 1940. Appointed Peoples Commissar for Defense, he started a modernisation and mechanisation programme for the Red Army. In June 1941  Germany  attacked the  Soviet Union  and Timoshenko was placed in charge of the central front; he is credited with preserving his forces to successfully defend  Moscow  in late 1941. In May 1942 he led a Soviet assault on  Kharkov  which had limited success, and he was unable to prevent the German advance on  Stalingrad  in the summer and autumn of 1942.

He was replaced by Marshal  Georgi Zhukov  as the prime front line commander, but was subsequently given honorific appointments.
