The  Firth of Forth  is the estuary of the river Forth in  Scotland  which rises in Loch Ard in the Trossachs. The interesting sound of the name led to its use in the popular Scottish children's rhyme  Go Forth .

At present, the Firth of Forth is spanned by two bridges: the Forth Bridge (completed in 1890 and often referred to as the Forth Rail Bridge) and the Forth Road Bridge (completed in 1964). A new bridge, the Queensferry Crossing, is set to open in 2016. [1]
