Islam  has produced some of the most repressive cultures in history. But even Islamic cultures can produce fun/rhythmic music as can be seen  HERE  and  HERE  and  HERE  and  HERE  and  HERE .

The atheist nerds in the Western World haven't really produced much, if any, fun/rhythmic songs. That is because Western atheism is dominated by  atheist nerds . In addition, many atheists are depressed due to their bleak worldview (see:  Atheism and suicide  and  Atheism and depression  and  Atheism, agnosticism and pessimism ).

Face it atheists: Male, atheist nerds in the West are wet blankets. And overweight, feminist, lesbian atheists are lousy belly dancers!!!! See:  Lesbianism and obesity  and  Atheism and obesity  and  Atheist feminism .

Most countries in the Middle East have Muslim majorities in terms of their populations. Middle Eastern food taste better than much of bland food in irreligious cultures (See:  Atheism, food science and bland food ). Why do so many atheist cultures have bland food? Is it because many atheists are bland?

Claude Lewis wrote in  The Philadelphia Inquirer  about the food is the former  Soviet Union  which had militant  state atheism :

Question:  Of the two options below, which sounds better?

Option 1:  Going to Middle Eastern restaurant and eating a shish kabob, rice, falafel, hummus, pita bread and a flavorful salad while watching a slim and graceful belly dancer.

Option 2 : Going to a franchise which specializes in recreating the following: Eating bland food in a state run cafeteria in the former Soviet Union. There are no belly dancers in the cafeteria style dining experience.

Flavorful food Christians are known for: Eggnog, Christmas cookies and Easter hams

Flavorful food commonly associated with atheism: Nothing. Absolutely nothing!
