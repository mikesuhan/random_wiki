Agenda 21  is a  United Nations   globalist  program as a result of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) which was held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 introduced with goals relating to the world economy, the environment and education.  Agenda 21 is most known for its aims at combating extreme  deforestation  and protecting fragile  environments  and maintaining  biodiversity  among them.

Many  conservatives  feel it interferes with community development at a local level and aims at abolishing  private property  worldwide. [1]

Agenda 21 is also the name of a fiction book by  Glenn Beck  and Harriet Parke that deals with the possible outcome of the initiative.
