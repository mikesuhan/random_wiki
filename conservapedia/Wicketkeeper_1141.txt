A  wicketkeeper  is a fielder in  cricket  that stands directly behind the  stumps  behind the  batsman  facing. His job is to collect the ball if the batsman doesn't play it. He can also dismiss batsmen, either by taking a catch if the ball snicks the edge of the bat or by using the ball to knock the wicket if the batsman is out of his crease (called stumping).
