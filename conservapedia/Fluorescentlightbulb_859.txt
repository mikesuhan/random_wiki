Fluorescent light bulbs  are lamps that use the phenomena of fluorescence to produce  light . Fluorescence is the emission of  radiation  by a substance that is exposed to an external source of radiation. [1]  They are much more efficient than traditional incandescent bulbs, since incandescent bulbs waste most of their energy producing heat rather than light. [2]

Fluorescent bulbs consist of  glass  tubes filled with low pressure  mercury - argon  vapor. The inner wall of the tube is coated with a white phosphor. A heated filament emits electrons into the vapor, causing the vapor  atoms  to emit  ultraviolet  light. This ultraviolet light is then absorbed by the white phosphor and re-emitted as visible light. [3] 
While running, fluorescent lights send pulses of electricity (electrons) through the tube to cause this effect.  As a result, the light emitted by these lights also pulses.  However, most people can not detect the pulsing under normal conditions, because they take place so rapidly that the light emissions appear constant.  Although the pulse rates vary depending on the kind of florescent light bulb, [4]  they generally run at a rate of about 120 cycles per second (120 Hz). [5]
