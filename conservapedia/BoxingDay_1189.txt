Boxing Day  is a public  holiday  held on the day after  Christmas  in a number of countries which were formerly part of the  British Empire , such as the  United Kingdom ,  Australia , and  New Zealand .

Numerous explanations for Boxing Day have been proffered, but the  Oxford Dictionary  lists it as being "from the former custom of giving tradespeople a Christmas box on this day". [1]
