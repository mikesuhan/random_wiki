Locusts  are migratory  grasshoppers . They are known to cause great damage to crops wherever they swarm. A typical swarm can eat as much food as 2500 people in a single day. [1]

In the  Book of Exodus  in the  Bible ,  God  sent locusts to wreak havoc among the  Egyptians  as one of the  ten plagues  to get them to release the  Hebrews  from bondage.
