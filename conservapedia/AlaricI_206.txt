Alaric I  was King of the  Visigoths  in the early 5th century AD.  He led them, when quite an old warrior, into the Italian peninsula, and they took and sacked  Rome  in AD 410, an event seen by many as being a sign that the World was about to end.  Alaric was an  Arian   Christian  and did not permit his warriors to loot or destroy the City's churches.  They did not remain in Rome, but moved south, attempting, it is said, to reach  North Africa .  But Alaric died, and was buried in a river bed (the river being temporarily diverted for this purpose) with much treasure.  His name in Gothic was probably 'Alareiks'.
