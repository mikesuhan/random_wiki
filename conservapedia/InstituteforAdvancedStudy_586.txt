The Institute has a permanent faculty of 27 scholars and 190 visiting members. The Institute's web page mentions, as particularly  notable faculty, " Albert Einstein , who remained at the Institute until his death in 1955, and distinguished scientists and scholars such as  Kurt GÃ¶del ,  J.

The "Princeton machine," also known as the "IAS machine," was a pioneering computer designed by Von Neumann and built at the IAS. It was completed in 1952. After its completion, about a dozen similar "IAS machines" were built elsewhere. Von Neumann's work at the IAS transformed "computers" from specialized numerical calculators like ENIAC into the general-purpose stored-program device we know today. [2]  The machine was used in the development of nuclear weapons; during the summer of 1951 Los Alamos ran a calculation on it that required sixty days to complete. It continued in useful service until 1960. [3]
