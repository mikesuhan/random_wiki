In  Jett v. Dallas Ind. Sch. Dist. , 491 U.S. 701, 735 (1989), the  U.S. Supreme Court  held that 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 ( Section 1983 ) provides the exclusive remedy for violation by state actors of the rights guaranteed in  section 1981 .

In 1991,  Congress  passed and  President   George H.W. Bush  signed into law Section 1981(c) as part of the 1991 amendments to the  Civil Rights Act . This provision overruled the  Jett  decision.

Congress thereby clarified that both Section 1983 and Section 1981 may be utilized to redress discriminatory state action.  Gallardo v. Board of County Comm'rs , 857 F. Supp. 783, 786 (D. Kan. 1994). The reference to nongovernmental discrimination is simply a codification of the holding of  Runyon v. McCrary , 427 U.S. 160 (1976), that Section 1981 addresses private as well as state discrimination. See H. Rep. No. 102-40(I), 102d Cong., 1st Sess. 92, reprinted in 1991 U.S.S.C.A.N. 549, 630. Congress intended to expand the scope of civil rights protection, not limit it.
