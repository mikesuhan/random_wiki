The  Great Fire of Rome  was a massive  fire  which started on July 19, 64AD. The fire destroyed the  Circus Maximus  as well as a large portion of the city. Rumors that the  Roman Emperor  at the time,  Nero , started the fire himself and fiddled as the city burned are unsubstantiated, but were spreading across the populace.  Nero found a  scapegoat  to blame.

The Great Fire became the catalyst for the first wave of state sponsored persecution of  Christians  in the Roman Empire when Nero claimed that local Christians started it. According to the Roman historian  Tacitus , apart from being killed in the arena, their bodies were also used as lamps to help light the city at night.
