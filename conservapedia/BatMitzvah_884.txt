Bat Mitzvah  ( Hebrew  for daughter of the commandments, or more literally, one to whom the commandments apply) is a ceremony held for a  Jewish  girl when she takes on adult responsibilities.  It is similar to the  Bar Mitzvah  held  for a boy but in many Jewish traditions takes place a year earlier when she is 12, as girls mature earlier than boys.  The first public "Bat" Mitzvah was the Bat Mitzvah of Judith Kaplan (the daughter of the Reconstructionist movement founder  Mordecai Kaplan ) in  New York City  in 1922.  However, the idea of a recognition of a girl's coming-of-age started as early as the mid-nineteenth century, when Jews in  Italy ,  France , and  Germany  sometimes celebrated the 12th birthday of their daughter as a milestone, albeit with a party or dinner and not a ceremony.
