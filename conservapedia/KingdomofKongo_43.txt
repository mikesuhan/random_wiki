The  Kingdom of Kongo  was a Bantu-speaking society that lasted from sometime after A.D. 1000 to the 1500s.  It consisted of present-day Congo and Angola.  It declined once the Portuguese explored and invaded the west coast of  Africa  from the late 15th century, and introduced the Catholic religion to the Kongo.
