J. W. Hampton, Jr. & Co. v. United States , 276 U.S. 394(1928), is a  landmark [1] [2]  case in the United States in which the  Supreme Court of the United States  ruled that congressional delegation of legislative authority is an implied power of Congress that is constitutional so long as Congress provides an "intelligible principle" to guide the executive branch.  This creates what is called the  Nondelegation doctrine .

Justice  Clarence Thomas  offered a stinging rebuke of this  intelligible principle  in his written opinion in the  Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc.  case [3] [4]

In allowing congress to delegate its powers to the  Executive Branch  in violation of the principles of  separation of power , the supreme court played an important role in the long term viability of the  administrative state .
