Friends  was situation comedy  television  series created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman and heavily promoted by  liberals  and the  media .  It ran from 1994-2004 and featured six "friends" in their 20s living in  New York City .  Unlike most situation comedies, it relied on a live audience [1]  instead of canned laughter to "strengthen" the jokes.

The show deceptively promoted activities such as sex outside of  marriage , and  homosexuality , without disclosing the adverse effects such behavior, including increased  disease ,  infertility ,  depression  and  domestic violence .

The show was made by Warner Brothers Studios. [2]

A spin-off show about one of the characters (Joey), but ultimately failed. [3]
