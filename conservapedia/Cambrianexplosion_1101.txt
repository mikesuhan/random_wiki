The  Cambrian explosion  is how every current complex  phylum  appeared suddenly in the  fossil record , contrary to what was expected by the slowly evolving lifeforms predicted by the  Theory of Evolution .  Lacking a coherent explanation, Darwinists and Old-Earth creationists describe this period, which they claim was 540 million years ago, as the "Big-Bang of life."  In fact, the Cambrian explosion casts serious doubt on the idea that significant new forms of life came into being via slow, gradual  Darwinian  processes.  It is the time during which all life (except sponge embryos) appeared in the fossil record.  Below the Cambrian layer, there is no fossilized evidence of life, except for a small number of sponge embryos just bellow the Cambrian layer, presumably due to contamination. Above the Cambrian layer, no new species ever appears.  The only evolution which has taken place since is that of separate breeds within certain species branching out over time.

The Cambrian explosion was "discovered" in the  Burgess Shale  of  British Columbia ,  Canada  in 1909 by  Charles D. Walcott , the then secretary of the  Smithsonian Institute . [1]  In a moment some would say is telling of how damaging the Cambrian explosion was to Walcott's Darwinian world-view, the lone publication of his remarkable discovery was in the sparsely-read  Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections . The findings were then  conveniently  ignored for several decades. [2]

In the documentary " The Case for a Creator ,"  Intelligent Design  proponent and respected biologist  Jonathan Wells  had this to say about the Cambrian explosion:

To try to explain this away by saying Darwin’s theory accounts for it is a science-stopper. It’s the biggest science-stopper of modern history. It stops your inquiry right there. You have no more questions. Oh, all these animals just appeared. That’s not science. [3]
