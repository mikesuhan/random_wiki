The  Convention on Cluster Munitions  is an international agreement, signed by 111 nations, banning all forms of  cluster bombs . It is opposed by the U.S., China, Russia, India, and other producers of weapons.

Despite the convention's high-minded ideals, a provision was added allowing signatories to still participate in military operations with non-signatories, greatly weakening the convention.
