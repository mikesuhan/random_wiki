Usufruct  is the legal right to the use of someone else's property, to derive benefits from it, without the right to dispose of the property.  With regard to real property, it is vaguely similar to the common law  life estate , or an  easement .  Usufruct is a civil legal term taken from the French Napoleonic Code and currently in use only in Louisiana.

An example would be, Citizen A owns an estate adjoining Citizen B, who has a certain fruit tree. Citizen B grants Citizen A the right to pluck fruit from the tree. Alternately, it could imply the right to travel across Citizen B's land without being charged for trespass. Legal goals similar to the latter are today accomplished through easements.
