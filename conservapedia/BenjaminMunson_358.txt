H. Benjamin Munson  (ca. 1916 - July 27, 2003) was a  physician  who performed  abortions  in  Rapid City ,  South Dakota , both before and after legalization. [1]

Munson's practice was illegal prior to the  Roe vs. Wade   U.S. Supreme Court  decision in 1973. Until his retirement in 1986, he was the only physician in South Dakota to perform abortions. [1]

Munson opened his practice in 1967. He was arrested in 1969 for performing an abortion on a 19-year-old patient. Munson challenged his conviction, winning in circuit court. The state appealed, and the South Dakota Supreme Court ruled against him. He appealed this decision, which was rendered moot by  Roe . [1]

In 1973, Munson discharged a 28-year-old patient after an  incomplete abortion . She died of  sepsis  three days later. Munson was charged with  manslaughter . Seventh Circuit Judge  Merton Tice, Jr.  instructed the  jury  to acquit, saying that the state's case was inadequate because prosecutors could not prove that Munson intended harm to his patient. Then- Attorney General   Bill Janklow  contended that Munson's culpability was clear. [2]

Munson died at age 87 in a  nursing home  in  Burlington ,  Vermont , of complications of  Alzheimer's disease . [1]

Munson was the father of one-time Rapid City Mayor  Jerry Munson . [1]
