In 2015, Pew Research indicated in their report  The Future of World Religions: Population Growth Projections, 2010-2050  that  agnostics  and  atheists  “will make up a declining share of the world’s total population.” [3]

The Center for the Study of Global Christianity (CSGC) at  Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary  estimated that agnostics made up about 12.8% of the global adult population in 2015.  CSGC projects that agnostics will makeup about 11.5% of the global adult population in 2025 and 9.1% of the global adult population in 2050. [4]

Secular Europe  has one of the highest rates of agnosticism rates in the world. In 2014, the Pew Research Forum indicated that  Europe  will go from 11% of the world's population to 7% of the world's population by 2050. [5]

The agnostic  Eric Kaufmann  is a professor of politics at Birkbeck, University of London and author.  His academic research specialty is how  demographic  changes affect religion/irreligion and politics.

Kaufmann wrote in 2010:

According to the agnostic scholar Kaufmann, in the Europe of tomorrow, immigration and religious fertility will increase the proportion of committed Christians in Europe, many from the developing world. [7]
