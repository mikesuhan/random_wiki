Although  biblical accuracy  is often questioned and dismissed by sceptics, there is much evidence of the  Bible  being a very accurate document.

Much of this accuracy is in the myriad of historical references that have been shown by  archaeology  to be correct, although other indications of its accuracy are its fulfilled  prophecies  and general explanations of humanity.

William F. Albright  said:

Luke , the author of the book bearing his name and the book of  Acts , includes numerous details that, together, would only be known to someone who was actually there at the time, given that names and titles frequently changed in his era.
In fact, Luke names nine islands, 32 countries, and 54 cities, and gets every one right. [3]

Luke also provides the titles of numerous officials, and in many cases scholars in the past have believed that he got these wrong, but subsequent discoveries have proved him to be right.
For example, Luke referred to the officials in  Thessalonica  as  politarchs , a term not used in any other ancient literature, and which caused many to believe that Luke was mistaken.
But inscriptions have since been found that show that this term was used in the area, specifically including Thessalonica. [4]
