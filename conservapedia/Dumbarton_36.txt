Dumbarton  ( fort of the  Britons ) is an ancient town on the north bank of the  Firth of Clyde  in Dunbartonshire (formally  Strathclyde  region) in south-eastern  Scotland . Originally  Alcuid , it has at various times since been referred to as  Dumbarton’’,  Dunbarton  and  Dumbritton .

Starting as a settlement on the east bank of the short River Leven, which connects the celebrated Loch Lomond to the Firth, it was the centre of a British ( Celtic ) kingdom before the  Romans  and endured as “British” (rather than of the  Picts  or Scots) through and after the Roman occupation of  England . Tradition has the 4th/5th century  St. Patrick  being born there. During the Dark Ages it expanded its control of much of south-east Scotland and became capital of the kingdom of  Strathclyde  before being taken over by the Scottish king  Malcolm II  and absorbed into a unified kingdom by  Duncan I  in 1034. It became a royal burgh in 1222.

Dumbarton Rock, which rises from the shore has been the site of fortifications since the  Iron Age . During the  Middle Ages  it became a royal castle.  William Wallace  was imprisoned there before he was taken to London to be executed. It was still garrisoned when Daniel Defoe visited the area in the years before 1724. Indeed, he spent more time describing the castle than the town. The Rock and Castle were the subject of a well known engraving by the German military engineer/artist, John Slezer, published in 1693.

Dumbarton's shipyards, opened in 1834 have been famous. The  clipper ,  Cutty Sark  was built there in 1869.

The town gave its name to the mansion in  Washington DC , “ Dumbarton Oaks ”, which  hosted the international conference in 1944 that prepared for the creation of the  United Nations . Earlier, a popular  Dumbarton Oaks   concerto  for orchestra was commissioned from  Igor Stravinsky  as an anniversary present by the owner, Robert Woods Bliss.
