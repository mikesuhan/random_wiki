The  blue-throated motmot  ( Aspatha gularis ) is a coraciiform bird of the family Momotidae, and found in the tropical areas of  Central America .

The Blue-throated motmot is small, up to 11 inches in total length.  The wings are short and rounded, while the grey-green tail is long; unlike other motmot species the two center feathers do not have racketed tips, for which some authorities have considered primitive. [2]   The coloration is rather lack-luster: differing shades of green above and below, with gray-green on the flight feathers.  A light russet-colored mask is over the face, with a small black streak behind each eye.  The throat bears a contrasting blue-colored bib.  The bill is two-tone, dark on the upper mandible and pale on the lower.  It is also smaller in size as compared to other motmots, and has a slight downward curve with serrated edges.  There is no sexual dimorphism; both adults look alike, while juveniles are an olive green throughout.

Blue-throated motmots are found in mountainous areas of southern Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua.  It inhabits the moist, high montane forested land, inhabiting oak pines and other evergreens, from about 4,000 feet to an altitude of 9,800 feet.  These birds will sit on a perch and still-hunt, taking insects and small vertebrates such as mice or lizards.  They nest in difficult-to-find holes dug into river banks or the forest floor during the wet season (April–June), with the entrance pipe some distance as well as curved before it ends at the nest.  The nest itself is made up of fragments of undigested prey items.  Up to three white eggs are laid during 48-hour intervals each, with an incubation period of 21–22 days.
