Actus reus  is a Latin legal term that means "guilty act" or "wrongful act." In the legal world,  actus reus  is combined with  mens rea  or to produce criminal liability within  common law  society. Without the  mens rea , the  actus reus  itself is not enough to produce criminal liability, except in terms of a strict liability offense.
