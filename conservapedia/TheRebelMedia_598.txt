The Rebel Media  is a  Canadian   conservative media  company founded by  Ezra Levant  shortly after the fall of  Sun News , the biggest conservative advocate in the Canadian  media . Rather than being on television, The Rebel hosts several online shows, which require a paid subscription to view, as well as a YouTube channel with regular conservative news updates. Among the staff is radio host  Brian Lilley ,  Faith Goldy ,  Lauren Southern ,  Gavin McInnes , and more.  [1] 
In December of 2016, Levant announced his "Big Plan" to make The Rebel more influential than  CTV ,  Global News , or even the  CBC . He asked for $63 000 in donations to pay for a new studio and equipment. The funds were quickly raised. 
The Rebel has also been responsible for many petitions, and for putting up many billboards across Canada, advertising conservative values and convicting liberal politicians, among them  Denis Coderre  and  Kathlynne Wynne .
