The "Jefferson Bible"  (properly known as  The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth ) is an interpretation of the New Testament by  Thomas Jefferson . This  controversial interpretation removes many passages and references to the divinity of Jesus.

Jefferson believed that the ethical system of  Jesus  was the finest the world has ever seen. In compiling his own version of  The Bible ,  he sought to separate those ethical teachings from the religious dogma and other supernatural elements that are intermixed in the account provided by the four Gospels. He presented these teachings, along with the essential events of the life of Jesus, in one continuous story, or biography. [1]
