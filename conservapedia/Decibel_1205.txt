The  decibel  ( dB ) is a logarithmic unit, often used to measure  sound  pressure . Decibel means 1/10 of a Bel, after  Alexander Graham Bell .  There is no absolute decibel scale, so the decibel is used to measure sound in comparison to another sound, i.e., the 0 dB reference. This  is defined as a sound pressure level of .0002 microbar, or 20 micropascals: commonly the threshold of hearing a sound with a frequency of 1 kHz.
