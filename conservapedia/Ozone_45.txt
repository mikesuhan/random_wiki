Ozone  is a chemical  compound  consisting of three  oxygen  atoms.  It is represented by the symbol O 3 .

It is unstable at standard temperatures and pressures, and a powerful  oxidizer .  At the earth's surface it occurs naturally as a result of electrical discharges, most prominently in the form of  lightning . The majority of tropospheric ozone is created when  volatile organic compounds  (VOCs) and the products of combusted  fossil fuel  such as  nitrogen oxide  react in the presence of strong sunlight.

In the stratosphere it serves a very important function, by acting to filter out most of the  sun 's ultraviolet radiation.

Scientists have measured an annual cyclical thinning and thickening in the layer of ozone over the north and south poles. (Activists refer to this as an "ozone hole".)

Much of this is a result of the breakdown of  chlorofluorocarbons  and the release of elemental  chlorine , which acts as a  catalyst  to break down the O 3  molecules. [1]

According to the  EPA , "Ozone is a light bluish gas that is harmful to breathe. Nearly 90% of the Earth's ozone is in the stratosphere and is referred to as the ozone layer. Ozone absorbs a band of ultraviolet radiation called UVB that is particularly harmful to living organisms. The ozone layer prevents most UVB from reaching the ground." [2]

Ozone in the lower atmosphere is a known cause of respiratory problems and currently causes up to 4,700 deaths per year.  [2]
