FANG stocks  are four high-tech stocks with large market capitalizations on the  NASDAQ  stock exchange.  They are Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), and Google (renamed "Alphabet") (GOOGL).  The term was first coined by Jim Cramer, a finance commentator on CNBC.

Their businesses are quite different from each other so it may not be that helpful to group them together.  It might be more meaningful to group Apple with Alphabet, for example, and Netfix and Amazon in separate categories.
