Christian Aid  is a  Christian  charitable organisation founded by  British  and  Irish  churches in the 1940s as  Christian Reconstruction in Europe  to provide aid to  refugees  from  World War Two .  Its stated purpose was "not to evangelise, but to alleviate suffering for ordinary people, no matter what their faith". [1]

Its mission has now grown to encompass fighting poverty around the world.  It aims to do this by providing benefits to those living in poverty, speaking out where it perceives those living in poverty are suffering injustice, and campaigning for changes it believes are needed to fight poverty.  Its current campaigns include raising awareness of  global warming , publicising poverty in conflict zones such as the  Palestinian Territories , promoting an approach to fighting  AIDS  that rejects  abstinence  as the most beneficial message, fighting  corruption  in poverty-stricken countries, and arguing for global trade agreements that will benefit poorer countries.

in 2006 it raised Â£93m for its causes.
