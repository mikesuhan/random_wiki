The  National Republican Senatorial Committee  (NRSC) is a political committee established by  Republican  members of the  United States Senate  supposedly to help Republican candidates develop the campaign resources they need to gain seats in the United States Senate. The current chairman is  Texas  Senator  John Cornyn .

While the NRSC raises money by claiming to support the election of Republican Senate candidates, in fact  RINOs  control how the money is spent and in 2012 they announced NRSC would withhold funds from the election of  pro-life   Todd Akin  of  Missouri .

Most of the recent leadership of the NRSC has been by Republicans unable or unwilling to win reelection themselves.

The committee was established in 1916, in response to the ratification of the  Seventeenth Amendment  to the  constitution  which provided for the direct election of  Senators . The committee was reorganized and renamed to its current name in 1948.
