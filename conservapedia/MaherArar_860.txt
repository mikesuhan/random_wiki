Maher Arar  is a Syrian-born  Canadian  citizen who, in the autumn of 2002, was detained by United States authorities when he arrived in  New York City  on a flight from  Zurich . Arar had planned to fly home to Ottawa from New York. Instead of deporting Arar to Canada, the US sent him first to  Jordan  and then to  Syria , where he was held for ten months before being released. When he arrived home in Canada, Arar told a story of how he was repeatedly tortured in a Syrian prison. [1]  In response to public outrage, the Canadian government called a public inquiry to investigate how this had happened to a Canadian citizen. Testimony at the inquiry strongly implicated Canadian authorities in cooperating with their United States counterparts and bearing some responsibility for what had happened.
