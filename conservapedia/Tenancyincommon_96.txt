Tenancy in common  is a form of  property  ownership in which several persons acquire property together and shares in its use or  rents .  Each can sell or convey his interest separately from the other owners.  Each has a right to use the entire property.  There is no right of survivorship, i.e., other tenants do not automatically obtain their co-tenant's interest when he passes away.

Other forms of property ownership are  joint tenancy  and  tenancy by the entirety .
