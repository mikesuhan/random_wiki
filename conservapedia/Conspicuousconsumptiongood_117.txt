A  conspicuous consumption good  is affected by socially-created forces, where its consumption decreases with a decrease in  price . An example would be any high-end designer product where a large component of its value, lies in the "luxury factor" which is tied to price. It is hypothesized that if a  consumer  was able to purchase a conspicuous consumption good at a decreased price, without anyone else knowing, the conspicuous consumption effect would be negated.
