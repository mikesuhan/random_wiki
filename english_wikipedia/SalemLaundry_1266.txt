The  Salem Laundry  is a historic  laundry  building at 55 Lafayette Street in  Salem, Massachusetts . It is listed on the  National Register of Historic Places  as  "Salem Landry" . Built in 1906, it is the first  concrete  building to be erected in Salem. The four story building is divided into three wide bays, with the central bay projecting slightly. The bays have broad windows divided by  ashlar -tooled concrete blocks, a styling that became fashionable in the following decade before unadorned concrete became more widely used. The building was built by, and has remained in the hands of, the Hooper family, who established a commercial laundry in Salem in 1806. [2]  It was listed on the National Register in 1983. [1]
