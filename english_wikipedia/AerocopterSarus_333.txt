The  Aerocopter Sarus  is a "mono-tilt-rotor rotary-ring"  VTOL  aircraft currently under development by  Aerocopter  Inc. It differs from previous  tiltrotors  in that instead of each rotor consisting of long blades attached to a central rotary ring, it has a single rotary ring which has a diameter equal to the entire wingspan of the aircraft, with the ring being attached to the tips of the wings. Small blades are attached to the outside of the ring. After vertical takeoff, the ring tilts from horizontal to vertical and the craft switches to flight mode with the fuselage of the aircraft being in the center of the ring.
