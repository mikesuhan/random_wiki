Patrick Makau Musyoki  (born 2 March 1985) is a runner from  Kenya . He was the former world record holder in the  marathon  with a time of 2:03:38, set at the 2011  Berlin Marathon , beaten by  Dennis Kipruto Kimetto  in 2014. [1]  He is also notable for his  half marathon  performances, having won a number of prominent competitions in Europe in sub-1-hour performances.

Makau attended Unyuani School until 1999, after which he joined Kyeni Academy, Misiani. He started running in 2001. [2]  He competed at the  2006 IAAF World Road Running Championships  and finished in 26th place.

He finished second at the 2007  Ras Al Khaimah Half Marathon  by running 59:13 minutes, being beaten only by  Samuel Wanjiru  who set the world record (58:53) at the same race. [2]  He won silver at the  2007 IAAF World Road Running Championships  and  2008 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships . He was also part of the Kenyan team that won the team race both times. [2]

He won at the  City-Pier-City Loop  in 2008. Makau won the 2009 Ras Al Khaimah Half Marathon setting the second best ever half marathon time 58:52. The world record at the time, 58:33, was held by Samuel Wanjiru. [3]  He made his marathon debut at the 2009  Rotterdam Marathon , finishing fourth and setting a fast time (2:06:14 hours), [4]  short of the fastest marathon debut, set by  Evans Rutto  at the 2003  Chicago Marathon  (2:05:50 hours). [5]

Makau returned to the Hague for the City-Pier-City Loop in 2010 and won for a second time, clocking another sub-one hour time of 59:52. [6]  After this he significantly improved his marathon best to 2:04:48 to win the Rotterdam Marathon, becoming the fourth fastest runner over the history of the distance. [7]  He opted to stay away from the circuit and focus himself entirely on preparations for the  Berlin Marathon . [8]  A rematch with Rotterdam runner-up  Geoffrey Mutai  saw the two take the same positions again. Rain dampened the prospect of a record but Makau out-sprinted Mutai at the finish to clock 2:05:08 and win his first  World Marathon Major . [9]  In recognition of his performances that year, he was selected as the  AIMS World Athlete of the Year  in a poll of race organisers. [10]

Makau ran in the  2011 London Marathon  and, in spite of a fall at the halfway point, he continued and was narrowly beaten into third at the line by  Martin Lel , finishing with a time of 2:05:45. [11]

At the  Berlin Marathon  on 25 September 2011, Makau was set to duel against  Haile Gebrselassie , the world record holder from  Ethiopia . The Kenyan dropped his more experienced rival after the halfway point and went on to finish in a world record time of 2:03:38 (an average pace of 4:42.9 per mile), beating the existing record by 21 seconds. [12]  Prior to the race, he stated that he wanted to bring the  marathon world record  back to Kenya, following on from a former record holder  Paul Tergat . [13]  Speaking after the race, Makau said "In the morning my body was not good but after I started the race, it started reacting very well. I started thinking about the record" [13]  and "At 32 km I thought I could win the race and even break the world record. It was hard [over] the last 10 kilometres". [14]  His world record performance remained for 2 years before falling to fellow Kenyan,  Wilson Kipsang Kiprotich , at the 2013 Berlin Marathon, when the record was lowered another 15 seconds to the time of 2:03:23. [15]

He was the pre-race favourite for the  Granollers Half Marathon  in February, but lost in a sprint finish to  Carles Castillejo  under cold weather conditions. [16]  He ran at the  2012 London Marathon  but dropped out mid-race due to injury and was not selected for the Olympic team. [17]  He entered the  Great Manchester Run  in May and came fifth in a time of 28:21 minutes. [18]  In the  Frankfurt Marathon  in October, despite feeling uncomfortable and running most of the time at the back of the leading group, Makau managed to take back the lead from  Deressa Chimsa  and holding on for the victory, with a time of 2:06:08. [19]

Makau raced in the 2013 London Marathon. He showed to be in poor form, having been outside the lead pack already by the first time point at 5km, falling farther and farther behind with every time point until 40km. By halfway, he was nearly 3 minutes behind the leaders, but he slowed further and eventually finished the race in 2:14:10, outside the top 10, more than 8 minutes back from the winner, and more than 10 minutes back from his own world record.
