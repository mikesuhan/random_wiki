A prolific  centre-forward , he scored over 300 goals throughout his career, only playing in the higher divisions towards the end of his career, becoming the oldest player to win the  Serie A Top-scorer award , which he managed during the  2001–02 Serie A  season, at the age of 35; this record was later broken by  Luca Toni  in 2015, who won the award at the age of 38. 38 of Hübner's career goals came from penalties, whilst he was sent off 10 times throughout his career, also receiving 36 yellow cards.

On his debut, he scored his first goal in Serie A, against  Inter  at the  San Siro  Stadium, from an Andrea Pirlo assist, and on his second appearance, he scored a hat-trick against  Sampdoria . [3]  Notwithstanding his impressive tally of 16 goals, Brescia were relegated to  Serie B the following season , although he was later named the club's  captain  and main penalty taker, and helped the side to re-gain promotion to Serie A, scoring 21 goals during the  1999–2000 Serie B  season. [3]  During the  2000–01 season , he played alongside attacking midfield  playmaker   Roberto Baggio , the team's new captain, under coach  Carlo Mazzone , while he also faced competition as the starting striker from  Igli Tare , who had a higher work-rate than Hübner. Alongside Baggio, Hübner was extremely prolific, as he scored 17 goals, helping the club to qualify for the  2001 UEFA Intertoto Cup . He was also famous for smoking on the bench during his time at Brescia, and was known for drinking  grappa . [4] [5] [6] [7]

Along with  Igor Protti , Hübner is the only player to have won the top scoring titles in  Serie A ,  Serie B , and  Serie C1  (winning the Serie B Top-scorer title during the  1995–96 seaason  with  Cesena , scoring 22 goals, and the Serie C1, Girone A Top-scorer title during the 1991–92 season with  Fano , scoring 14 goals.

He later moved on to play for  Mantova  in  Serie C1  (2004–05).

In September 2005 he left professional football and signed for  Chiari  of  Serie D , which he left two months later to join  Rodengo Saiano , another Serie D club (2005–06).
