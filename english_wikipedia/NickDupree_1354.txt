Nicholas Folk "Nick" Dupree  (February 23, 1982 â€“ February 18, 2017) [1]  was an American  disability rights  activist and writer. [2] [3] [4] [5]  His campaign labeled "Nick's Crusade" resulted in a special program for 30 ventilator-dependent  Alabamians  (including himself and his younger brother) to continue home care after they turn 21 years old. [4] [5]

He was born in  Morgantown, West Virginia , on February 23, 1982, with  mitochondrial disease . [5] [6]  Despite the disease, he was able to go to school by himself, feed himself, and use a manual wheelchair for several years into his childhood. On September 13, 1991, an infected surgical site during a  Luque rods  surgery triggered a collapse that killed Dupree's remaining  muscle tone . [6]

In October 1991 he got his first  feeding tube , and he first began using a non-invasive  BiPAP  ventilator to breathe in February 1992. [6]  In 1994, due to respiratory failure, Dupree underwent a  tracheostomy  and began using a ventilator to breathe at all times.

Dupree was admitted to  Spring Hill College  in  Mobile, Alabama , at age 16. [6]

Dupree organized "Nick's Crusade", a campaign which attempted to gain continued in-home services for Alabamians with disabilities who are over the age of 21. [4] [7]  On February 10, 2003,  United States Department of Health and Human Services  secretary  Tommy G. Thompson  announced a limited program in Alabama that would fund in-home services for Dupree and 29 others who were turning 21 shortly. [4] [7]

Dupree lived in  New York City  since 2008 with his partner  Alejandra Ospina , who is also a disability rights activist. In 2010, the couple held a public commitment ceremony in New York's  Central Park , conducted in part to dramatize concern that people with disabilities are dissuaded from marrying because of U.S. government rules that could cause them to lose  disability benefits  if they were married. [8]  He enjoyed writing, and was working on his  memoir .

He was a prolific  webcomic  artist who self-published a variety of comics in different styles. He also enjoyed creating self-portraits, along with portraits of family and friends, [9]  some of which were exhibited publicly in New York City. [10]

Dupree had an unknown  muscular disorder  believed to be related to the  metabolic cycle  and  carnitine . Due to his disability, he depended on a ventilator to breathe, and used a wheelchair, though he was often bedbound. He worked, created art, and communicated via the computer by using his thumb on a  trackball mouse . He clicked out text on the computer screen using  KeyStrokes , an on-screen keyboard.

Dupree passed away in the early morning hours of February 18, 2017, just 5 days shy of his 35th birthday. He had spent the last 9.5 months of his life living in hospital and nursing home environments, which he had always sought to avoid as part of his personal advocacy. He developed sepsis and suffered cardiac failure after battling many months of facility-acquired infections. [11]
