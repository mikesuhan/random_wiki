Dr.  Ernest Mark Henley  (June 10, 1924 in  Germany  â€“ March 27, 2017 [1] ) was an  American   atomic  and  nuclear physicist . [2]

In 1944 Dr. Henley received a B.E.E. in Electrical Engineering from the  City College of New York . From 1944 to 1946, he served in the navy, decommissioning and repairing electrical equipment on ships. He worked at the  Airborne Instruments Laboratory  as an electrical engineer from 1946 to 1948. Between 1950 and 1951 he worked at  Stanford University , and received a Ph.D. from  UC Berkeley  in 1952. From 1952 to 1954, he was a Jewett Fellow and lecturer at  Columbia University . In 1954, Dr. Henley accepted a faculty position at the  University of Washington  where he remained for his entire career, serving as Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences between 1979 to 1987.

Over the course of his research career, Dr. Henley studied symmetries in nuclear physics. [3]  In 1976 Dr. Henley calculated with Lawrence Wilets the effects on parity non-conservation in atomic physics. [4]  From 1979 to 1987 he was Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences there and Director of the Institute for Theoretical Nuclear Physics in 1990-1991. He has been Professor  Emeritus  since 1995. [5]  He dedicated his retirement to teaching Physics at the University of Washington's  Transition School and Early Entrance Program , the Robinson Center for Young Scholars. [6]  In 2014 at the age of 90 (and much to the disappointment of his students) Dr. Henley retired from this position.

Since 1979 he was a member of the  National Academy of Sciences . In 1992 he was president of the  American Physical Society , where he chaired the Nuclear Physics section from 1979 to 1980. In 1989 he received the  Tom W. Bonner prize in nuclear physics .
