Matti Antero Hautamäki  ( Finnish pronunciation:  [ˈmɑtːi ˈɑntero ˈhɑutɑmæki] ; born 14 July 1981) is a Finnish former  ski jumper  who competed from 1997 to 2012. He is one of Finland's most successful ski jumpers, having won sixteen individual  World Cup  competitions; multiple medals at the  Winter Olympics ,  Ski Jumping World Championships , and  Ski Flying World Championships ; the  Nordic Tournament  twice; and four  ski flying world records . Together with  Thomas Morgenstern , Hautamäki currently holds the hill record in  Harrachov  with a distance of 214.5 metres (704 ft), set on  9 March 2002 .

Hautamäki started ski jumping at the age of seven near his hometown of  Oulu . When his older brother  Jussi  and friend  Lauri Hakola  moved to  Kuopio , Matti joined them. At first he found it difficult to be independent at the age of sixteen, but he received much help and support from his brother, with whom he was living at the time. The help of his new coach  Pekka Niemelä , whom he met at the sports school in Kuopio, also helped him advance quickly. In the same year Matti had his first real successes and won medals at the 1997 and 1999 FIS Junior World Ski Jumping Championships.

At the  Four Hills Tournament  in  2001/02 , Hautamäki finished second, his highest ever place in that tournament. In  2002  and  2005  he won the Nordic Tournament, with a clean sweep of all four events in the latter. It was during the 2004–05 season that he won six individual events in a row, including the pre- Winter Olympics  rehearsal in  Pragelato , and the first  ski flying  event in  Planica ; this matched the record for the most consecutive victories set by countryman  Janne Ahonen  in the same season. Hautamäki also won the ski jumping event at the 2005  Holmenkollen Ski Festival  in  Oslo .

Hautamäki was regarded as a specialist at ski flying, with the majority of his personal best distances being achieved in Planica. An early sign of things to come was showcased on  23 March 2002  when he jumped 224.5 metres, nearly equalling the then-world record of 225 m set  two years prior  by  Andreas Goldberger . At the  20–23 March 2003  event, Hautamäki set three consecutive world records of 227.5 m (746 ft), 228.5 m (750 ft), and 231 m (758 ft); the latter making him the first to ever officially land a jump over 230 m. [1]  His record stood until  20 March 2005 , a day on which it was equalled once by  Tommy Ingebrigtsen  and later broken a further three times in spectacular fashion:  Bjørn Einar Romøren  first jumped 234.5 m (769 ft) during the morning training round, followed by Hautamäki momentarily reclaiming the record with 235.5 m (773 ft) in the afternoon event. This was then shattered again by Romøren only minutes later, who jumped 239 m (784 ft). Some minutes after that, Janne Ahonen jumped  240 m (790 ft) , but this was rendered invalid due to him falling hard upon landing.
