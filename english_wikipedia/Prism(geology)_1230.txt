In  sedimentology , a  prism  is a long, narrow, wedge-shaped  sedimentary  body. These types of sediments are typically formed during  orogenic  deformation; for example, the  arkose  detrital sedimentary rock found in  fault troughs . [1]

In  mineralogy ,  prismatic  is also type of  mineral habit  (appearance of a crystal). Prismatic minerals have crystals that show a uniform  cross-section . Prismatic crystals typically have 3, 4, 6, 8 or 12 faces which are parallel to a  crystallographic axis . [2]  The  apatite  group of minerals commonly exhibit elongated hexagonal prisms. [2]

An accretionary prism or accretionary wedge is formed from  sediments  that are  accreted  onto the non- subducting   tectonic plate  at a  convergent plate boundary . Most of the material in the accretionary wedge consists of marine sediments scraped off from the downgoing  slab  of  oceanic crust  but in some cases includes the erosional products of volcanic  island arcs  formed on the overriding plate.

Crystal habit is an overall description of the visible external shape of a mineral. This description can apply to an individual crystal or an assembly of crystals or  aggregates . Predominant crystal faces (prism - prismatic, pyramid - pyramidal and pinacoid - platy). Crystal forms (cubic, octahedral, dodecahedral). Aggregation of crystals or aggregates (fibrous, botryoidal, radiating, massive). Crystal appearance (foliated/lamellar (layered), dendritic, bladed, acicular, lenticular, tabular (tablet shaped)). [3]
