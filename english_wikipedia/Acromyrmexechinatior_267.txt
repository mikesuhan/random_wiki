In  Costa Rica  this species prefers open dry habitats such as urban areas around  San Jose  and seasonally dry habitats of  Guanacaste  Province. There is evidence to suggest that this species nests may occasionally be  arboreal . [ citation needed ]

Queens multiply mate, and colonies are facultatively  polygynous . Nonreproductive workers of the colony 'police', that is, selectively destroy worker-laid eggs, but don't attack reproductive workers. Relatedness incentives are the most likely ultimate cause of the evolutionary maintenance of workerâ€“egg policing in  A. echinatior . [ citation needed ]
