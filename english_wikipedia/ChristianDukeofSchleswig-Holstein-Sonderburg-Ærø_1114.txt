Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Ærø  (26 November 1570 – 14 June 1633) was the first and only  partitioned-off duke  of  Ærø . As a partitioned-off duke, he did not have sovereignty.

He was the eldest son of Duke  John II  (1545-1622) and at his father's death, he inherited the island of Ærø. His father had combined the small farms on the island into three manors:  Gråsten , Søbygård, and Gudsgave. In 1624, Christian created Voderup manor on land he had purchased from the church.

Christian had intended to become Bishop of Strasbourg; however this did not happen. He was a Protestant, but was nevertheless  canon  of the  cathedral chapter  of Strasbourg from 1587 to 1604. The Catholic chapter continued to pay him the salary of an unmarried priest until  c.  1619 .

Christian and his housekeeper Katharina Griebel (1570 in  Lütjenburg  – 1640 at Ærø) had a daughter: Sophie Griebel (b. 1600). To provide for her, he gave her two large houses in 1629, one in  Ærøskøbing  and the other on the island of Dejrø. She was also exempt from paying any taxes. After Christian's death, Katharina married his administrator, Peder Christensen Pilegaard, who then settled in Ærøskøbing as a merchant.

After Christian's death, his inheritance was divided by his four surviving brothers:

The division of the island into many small territories resulted in a complicated tax administration and an active black market. [1]
