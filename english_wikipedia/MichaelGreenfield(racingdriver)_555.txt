Michael Greenfield  (born 15 April 1963) is an American former owner-driver in the  CART  series. Born in  Whitestone, New York , he made 6  Indy Lights  starts in 1988. In 1989 he purchased a 1987  Lola  chassis and attempted to qualify for the  Indianapolis 500  and the  Pocono Raceway  event, crashing during practice both times. He returned the next year with the same car and competed in 7 races, his career-best finish of 12th coming in an attrition-filled  Meadowlands  race. He funded two more races with  Dale Coyne Racing  and competed in the  24 Hours of Daytona  in 1991, then returned in 1994 and 1995 to attempt to qualify for the Indy 500 with a 1993 Lola powered by a  pushrod  V8 engine designed and built by his father Peter. In 1994 Michael was not able to complete rookie orientation and the team was forced to hire  Johnny Parsons  to run the car, however, it never came up to speed and they did not make a qualifying attempt. In 1995 Michael took over driving duties but again failed to make a qualifying attempt. According to Peter Greenfield, the team was forced to modify the Lola chassis to accept the larger pushrod engine but in doing so had ruined its handling balance. [1]
