Tennessee State Route 365  ( SR-365 ) is a secondary north–south state highway located in  Chester County, Tennessee . It begins at  US Highway 45  (US-45) and  SR-5 . It then continues east through downtown  Henderson  as Main Street for approximately 0.8 miles (1.3 km) and turns in front of  Freed-Hardeman University   [1]  onto White Avenue and continues for approximately 2.5 miles (4.0 km) ending between mile markers 7 and 8 of US-45.
