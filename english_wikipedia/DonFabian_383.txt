Don Fabian  (born  Domingo Fabiano ) was an  Argentine   Bolero  composer, pianist and orchestra conductor.

Born in  Cordoba ,  Argentina  to Isabel Monferrato, daughter to an Italian musician, he learned music on his mother's piano. At a very early age he started playing live music for silent films in cinemas. Later he joined the "Los Diablos Rojos" orchestra conducted by Vicente Saturnini. Don Fabian used to perform at the old Eden Hotel in La Falda (a town located in the Cordoba mountains). At the age of 24 he left Cordoba and relocated to  Buenos Aires  where he began composing music for  Jazz ,  Tango  and Pop music ballads.

He then formed his first orchestra "Don Fabian y su Trio Vocal" which gained great success in the late 1940s and early 1950s. He also conducted the "Radio El Mundo" resident orchestra from 1946-1955. He wrote some of the most popular Bolero songs and ballads including "Coraz√≥n de Dios", "Cobardia", "Cumbia que vas de ronda" and "Dos almas".
