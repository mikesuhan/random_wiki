Assemble Insert   ( アッセンブル・インサート ,   Assenburu Insāto )  is a 1985  manga  series by  Masami Yuki  (best known for his manga and anime series  Mobile Police Patlabor ). The main character is a young would-be  idol  singer and high school student, Maron Namikaze, who has superhuman strength. She battles a  mecha  organization, Demon Seed, which has been terrorizing  Tokyo . The manga was adapted into a 2 episode  anime   OVA  in 1989. The series is a parody of Japanese pop culture.

Three CDs were released: a single on September 20, 1989, an image soundtrack on October 25, 1989, and a concert CD March 5, 1990.

In near-future Tokyo, a group called the Demon Seed has been antagonizing the city with its thefts and giant robotic Power Suits. After various failed attempts against the Demon Seed, the Special Operations Anti-Demon Seed Team (five men in a downtown office) begins to look for an idol to pilot a robotic suit against the Demon Seed. A talent show is held; and after a particularly dull line-up of contestants, the extremely strong Maron Namikaze is discovered. She is fitted with a metal costume and sent to take the Demon Seed down, all the while having an idol singer career forced upon her.

Helen McCarthy  in  500 Essential Anime Movies  stated that the OVA "remains an enjoyable bit of nonsense, with some of the biggest names on the anime scene on the crew list." [1]
