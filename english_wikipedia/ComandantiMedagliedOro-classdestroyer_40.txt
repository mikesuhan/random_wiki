The  Comandanti Medaglie d'Oro class  were a group of  destroyers  planned for the  Italian Navy  during  World War II . Twenty ships were ordered but none were launched by the time of the Italian Armistice.

The ships were to be significantly larger than the previous Italian destroyers, such as the  Soldati class . The armament was increased to four single  135 mm guns  (similar to those used in the  Capitani Romani-class   cruisers ) in dual purpose mountings. Twelve  37 mm (1.5 in)/54  guns comprised the light AA armament and two fire control directors were to be fitted (with  Gufo  radar).

The ships were named after recipients of the  Gold Medal of Military Valor . A total of 20 ships were ordered in 1941 from four shipyards; six from OTO Livorno, eight from CRDA Trieste, two from CNR Ancona and four from CT Riva Trigoso. Only nine ships were laid down and the hulls were broken up by the Germans or destroyed by Allied bombing.
