The station was the  terminus  of the  Over and Wharton branch line , a short branch off the  West Coast main line  operated by the  London and North Western Railway  and later the  London Midland and Scottish Railway  and  British Railways .

The passenger service, which was always meagre and in general did not offer good connections with other services, was eventually withdrawn and the station closed to passengers on 16 June 1947  ( 1947-06-16 ) .
