Estadio Rodrigo Paz Delgado , commonly called  La Casa Blanca  ( Spanish  for "The White House"), is a football stadium in  Quito ,  Ecuador  that is the home ground of  LDU Quito . Built between 1995 and 1997, the stadium hosted its first match on March 6, 1997 in a game between  LDU Quito  and  Atlético Mineiro  of  Belo Horizonte . With a capacity of 41,575, it is the largest stadium in Quito, and the second largest in Ecuador after the  Estadio Monumental Banco Pichincha  in  Guayaquil .

Since its inauguration, the stadium has been home to LDU Quito's greatest period of success where it has won six national titles and four international titles, thus making Liga Deportiva Universitaria the most successful team in the history of Ecuadorian football. In addition,  Barcelona SC  has never been able to defeat Liga at this stadium.

The  Ecuadorian national team  used this stadium twice during the  2002 FIFA World Cup qualification  on March 29, 2000 against  Venezuela  and August 15, 2000 against  Bolivia . Ecuador won both games.
