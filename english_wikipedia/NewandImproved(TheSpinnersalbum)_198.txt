New and Improved  is the fifth  album  by  American   R&B  group  The Spinners , released in December 1974 on the  Atlantic  label. Like the Spinners' two previous Atlantic albums,  New and Improved  was produced by  Thom Bell  and recorded at  Sigma Sound Studios  in  Philadelphia .

New and Improved  became the Spinners' third consecutive  R&B albums chart-topper  and reached #9 on the  Billboard  200 , their first top 10 album on this chart. The album includes " Then Came You ", featuring  Dionne Warwick  and the group's only single to top the  Billboard  Hot 100  (it was denied the top spot on the  R&B chart  by  Kool & the Gang 's "Higher Plane"), and the top 10 R&B singles "Laughing a Little, Loving a Little" and "Sadie" â€“ the latter track was covered by  R. Kelly  on his 1993 debut solo album  12 Play .
