The  Provincial Congress of New Jersey  was a transitional governing body of the  Province of New Jersey  in the early part of the  American Revolution . It first met in 1775 with representatives from all New Jersey's then-thirteen counties, to supersede the  Royal Governor . In June 1776, this congress had authorized the preparation of a constitution, which was written within five days, adopted by the Provincial Congress, and accepted by the  Continental Congress . The Constitution of 1776 provided for a  bicameral  legislature consisting of a General Assembly with three members from each county and a  Legislative Council  with one member from each county. All state officials, including the  governor , were to be appointed by the Legislature under this constitution. The  Vice-President of Council  would succeed the  Governor  (who was the President of the Council) if a vacancy occurred in that office. [1] [2]  The Provincial Congress ceased to function when the first session of the new Legislature convened on August 27, 1776, under the  New Jersey State Constitution  it had prepared. [2]

The Provincial Congress met in late May, June and August at Trenton. During their sessions in the first week, they elected from their members Hendrick Fisher, as the body's President, Jonathan D. Sergeant, as secretary, and  William Paterson  and  Frederick Frelinghuysen  assistants. The members, or "deputies" of the Congress, were received at its first session on 23 May 1775. [3]

Three Provincial Congress deputies,  Abraham Clark ,  John Hart  and the  Reverend John Witherspoon  signed the Declaration of Independence.
