Alyssa Jayne Milano  (born December 19, 1972) is an American actress, activist, producer and former singer. She is best known for her roles in  Who's the Boss? ,  Melrose Place ,  Charmed ,  Mistresses  and  Project Runway All Stars .

Milano was born on December 19, 1972, [1]  in  Bensonhurst, Brooklyn , [1] [2]  the daughter of fashion designer and talent manager Lin Milano and film-music editor Thomas M. Milano, [1]  (who had been an early member of the band  Sleepy Hollow  but left in 1972). [3]  She and her brother, Cory, [4]  who is seven years her junior, [5]  are of Italian ancestry. [6]  Her family remained in Bensonhurst until a neighborhood shooting prompted them to relocate to  Great Kills, Staten Island . [2]  She was raised  Roman Catholic . [7]

Milano began her career at age seven, when her babysitter, without notifying her parents, took her to an audition for one of the four principal parts in a national touring company of  Annie . Milano was one of four selected from more than 1,500 girls. During the course of her work in the play, Milano and her mother were on the road for 18 months. After returning to New York, she appeared in television commercials [8]  and did several roles in  off-Broadway  productions, including the first American musical adaptation of  Jane Eyre . When accompanying a friend from the  Annie  production to the office of a New York agent, Milano was introduced to the agent, who began representing her. [9]  She does not feel that growing up in front of the camera harmed her childhood, [5]  and has said: "I love my family very much – they've really backed my career. I consider myself to be normal: I've got to clean my room, and help in the kitchen." [10]

In August 1984, Milano made her film debut in the coming-of-age drama  Old Enough , which she recalled as a "great" way for "starting out". [2]  The film was screened at the  Sundance Film Festival , [11]  where it won First Prize. [12]

Milano auditioned as  Tony Danza 's daughter on the sitcom  Who's the Boss?  After winning the part, she and her family moved to Los Angeles, where the show was produced. It premiered on  ABC  on September 20, 1984. [9]  Throughout  Who's the Boss? , Milano developed a close relationship with co-star Danza. [13]  Commenting on their early years together, "She was just the sweetest little girl of all time ... She became much like my daughter." [9]  The series established Milano as a teen idol, [14] [15] [16]  and provided her opportunities for other roles. [15]  Her education was split between school and an on-set tutor with whom Milano would work for three hours a day. [17]

At age twelve, Milano co-starred in  Commando  as Jenny Matrix, the daughter of John Matrix ( Arnold Schwarzenegger ). [15]

On stage, she starred in  Tender Offer , a  one-act play  written by  Wendy Wasserstein ,  All Night Long  by American  playwright   John O'Keefe , [18] [19]  and the first American musical adaptation of  Jane Eyre . She returned to the theater in 1991, producing and starring in a  Los Angeles  production of  Butterflies Are Free  from December 26, 1991, to January 19, 1992. [9]

A few years later this film was shown in  Japan , prompting a producer to offer Milano a five-album record deal. Milano's albums, which she described as " bubblegum pop ", scored platinum in the country, though she later showed her discontent in their musical quality. [2]  Subsequently, she starred in the children's film  The Canterville Ghost , which did not achieve much praise or attention and  Variety  magazine noted in its review: "Milano as the catalyzing daughter Jennifer adapts to the ghostly Sir Simon without a qualm; that, of course, is the true charm of the story, but Milano doesn't exhibit enough presence to match the droll, charming Gielgud". [20]

Milano starred in two 1988 television films,  Crash Course  and  Dance 'til Dawn . Both projects allowed her to work alongside close personal friend  Brian Bloom  who worked with his brother  Scott  with her in episodes of  Who's the Boss ; this working camaraderie would later expand in 1993 when Milano made a  cameo appearance  in Bloom's film  The Webbers . She produced a teen workout video,  Teen Steam , and achieved some fame outside the USA with her music career, which lasted until the early 1990s. Even though she scored platinum in Japan, Milano had no interest to pursue a music career in the United States: "I'm not interested in crossing over. I'd much rather have it released where it's appreciated than laughed at." [14]  Simultaneously, she wrote a weekly column called "From Alyssa, with love" for the teen magazine  Teen Machine . [21]

Milano played a teenage prostitute in the 1992 independent film  Where the Day Takes You . The film, which focuses on a group of young runaway and homeless teenagers, [22]  was shot on and around  Hollywood Boulevard . [23]  and was met with positive critical reception. [24]  It was nominated for the Critics Award at the  Deauville Film Festival , and won the Golden Space Needle Award at the  Seattle International Film Festival . [25]

Although Milano feared that viewers would only recognize her as "the girl from  Who's the Boss? ", [14]  she was noticed by the media, which helped her land the role of  Amy Fisher  in the high-profile TV movie  Casualties of Love: The Long Island Lolita Story , one of three TV films based on Fisher's shooting of  Mary Jo Buttafuoco . [26] [27]  Milano said that her portrayal of Fisher in the film, which was based on the Buttafuoco's point of view, [26]  "was the least 'Alyssa' of anything [she had] done." [13]  The film was shot from November - December 1992. [28]  She welcomed the cancellation of the series, as she was ready to move on to other roles and enthusiastic to "showcase" what she was able to do. Looking back on eight years of playing the same role, Milano commented, "Creatively, it's been very frustrating. I gave her more of a personality. I changed her wardrobe, cut her hair, anything to give her new life." [14]

In the early 1990s, Milano auditioned for nearly every film role in her age bracket, including  B movies , [14]  and finally tried to shed her "nice girl" image by appearing nude in several erotic films targeted at adults, such as  Embrace of the Vampire ,  Deadly Sins  and  Poison Ivy II: Lily . She said the nude appearances taught her to begin requiring a  nudity clause  in her contracts giving her "full control" over all her nude scenes. [13]  In a 1995 interview, she explained her motivation for some explicit scenes in  Embrace of the Vampire : "I'm not going to say that I was manipulated into doing things that I didn't want to do. I did it because it was a woman director and I felt protected. And I learned a lot as far as knowing where the camera is and what coverage they need so that it's not all explicit." [21]

She starred in other roles, such as  Candles in the Dark ,  Confessions of a Sorority Girl ,  The Surrogate ,  To Brave Alaska  and  Fear , which did not receive very positive reviews, although the  Los Angeles Times  called Milano "very good" in the production. [29]

Milano starred in the lead role in  Hugo Pool  (1997).

In late 1996, Milano was offered a role of  Jennifer Mancini  on the drama  Melrose Place  by producer  Aaron Spelling : [30]  "We were looking for someone with sparkle. Alyssa was the perfect choice." [31]  She left early in season seven. In 1998, she was cast as  Phoebe Halliwell , one of the three lead characters on Spelling's show  Charmed .

I've stumbled over words while reading from teleprompters. Sir John Gielgud, whom I worked with on  The Canterville Ghost  years ago, gave me great advice. When I asked how he memorized his monologues, he said, "I write them down." I use that method to this day. It not only familiarizes me with the words, it makes them my own. [78]
