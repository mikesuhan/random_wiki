Herbert Clyde Lewis  (15 August 1909 - 17 October 1950 [1] ) was an American  novelist .

Lewis was born in New York City, the son of Hyman and Clara Lewis, Yiddish-speaking Russian immigrants. [1]

He lived in China, working as a reporter on the  Shanghai Evening Post  in 1930 and on the  China Press  in 1931 and 1932. [2]

He returned to New York City and married Gita Jacobson in December, 1933. They had two children, Michael and Jane. [3]

He worked as a reporter for the  New York Journal , but quit to work as an independent writer. [4]  Although he sold several stories to  Esquire (magazine) , he was forced to declare bankruptcy by the time he sold his first novel,  Gentleman Overboard , to the  Viking Press  in 1937. [5]

He moved to Hollywood and worked as a scenario writer for MGM in 1937. [6]  He contributed to the screenplay for the 1939 film,  Fisherman's Wharf  and wrote the original story for  Escape to Paradise . He returned to New York City in 1939 and worked for the  J. Walter Thompson  advertising agency. [4]  He returned to reporting, joining the news staff of the  New York Herald Tribune  in 1942. [7]

He returned to Hollywood in 1942 after 20th Century Fox bought the film rights to his story, "Two-Faced Qulligan" for $25,000. The story was originally published in  [Story (magazine)] . [7]  It was filmed in 1945 as  Two-Faced Quilligan . His story "D-Day in Las Vegas" was made into the movie  Lady Luck  (1946), and he contributed to the screenplay for  Free for All  (1949), which was based on his story, "Patent Applied For."

His most notable accomplishment in Hollywood was his story, "The Fifth Avenue Story," which he sold to the director  Frank Capra . Capra in turn sold it to  Roy Del Ruth , who filmed it in 1947 as  It Happened on Fifth Avenue . Lewis and his co-writer, Frederick Stephani, were nominated for the 1947  Academy Award for Best Story . They lost to  Valentine Davies , who won for  Miracle on 34th Street .

Lewis suffered a nervous breakdown in 1948 and was unable to work for a year after. He returned to New York in 1949 and was working as a contributing editor of  Time  magazine when he died of a heart attack. [4]

Lewis published three novels between 1937 and 1940.  Gentleman Overboard  was a  black comedy  about a  Wall Street  banker who falls overboard while travelling on a freighter in the South Pacific and drowns.  Time  magazine's reviewer wrote of the book, "His hair-raising little tour de force is the more effective for being so quietly, matter-of-factly written." [8]  His second novel,  Spring Offensive , was an anti-war piece that depicted the sufferings of an American serving in the British Army who becomes trapped between lines on the day of the first German assault on the  Maginot Line . At the time of its publication, the  Phony War  was still going on along the French-German border, but within weeks the German  Blitzkrieg  attack on France and the  Low Countries  took place and the novel was quickly forgotten.

His third novel,  Season's Greetings , follows the inhabitants of a  Greenwich Village  rooming house on a Christmas Eve. Its theme is “the problem of loneliness in a city of eight million people,” as one character puts it.

Lewis' last novel,  Silver Dark , which tells the story of a romance between two people with physical deformities, was published posthumously in 1959 by Pyramid Books.  Budd Schulberg  praised it as "A genuinely interesting and compelling novel".
