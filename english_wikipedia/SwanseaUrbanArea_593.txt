Coordinates :  51°38′06″N   3°51′04″W ﻿ / ﻿ 51.635°N 3.851°W ﻿ /  51.635; -3.851  The  Swansea Urban Area  or  Swansea Built-up Area  is an area of land in south  Wales , defined by the  Office for National Statistics  for population monitoring purposes. It is an urban  conurbation  and is not coterminous with the City and County of  Swansea . It consists of the urban area centred on  Swansea city centre ; the  Swansea Valley  including  Clydach ,  Ystradgynlais  and  Pontardawe ; and includes  Neath  and  Port Talbot  which lay outside the county boundaries, but excludes the urban area of  Gorseinon  within the county boundaries.

The total population of the area in 2011 was 300,352  [1]  making it the  24th largest conurbation in England and Wales  and the 3rd largest in Wales. This was an increase of 11% from the 2001 figure of 270,506. [2]  Most of the increase was due to Ystradgynlais, Gowerton, Upper Killay and Glais becoming part of the urban area.

The ONS provides sub-division statistics for the Swansea Urban Area [3]
