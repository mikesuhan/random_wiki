Expanse, Saskatchewan  is an  unincorporated area  in the  rural municipality  of  Lake Johnston No. 102 , in the  Canadian   province  of  Saskatchewan . Expanse is located just to the south of  Old Wives Lake  on a grid road. The grid connects to  Highway 2  near  Ardill  in south central Saskatchewan. Just to the south of  Highway 2  is Lake of the Rivers. Expanse is too small to be enumerated as a separate entity during the census taking, so it was a part of the population given for  rural municipality   Lake Johnston No. 102 .

Today the former community school, a private residence, a  Historical marker  and a few  foundations  are all that remain of Expanse's prosperous  pioneer  days.

The post office was formed on September 1, 1908, under the name Lake Johnston with postmaster Frank E. Crosby and was located at Sec.12, Twp.12, R.29, W of the  2nd meridian . A. S. MacDonald was the successor on May 1, 1912, and the post office now changed names to Expanse.

Canadian Pacific Railway  purchased the townsite in 1911 and named it Expanse.  Incorporated  as a Village in 1912, the first village meeting was held January 7, 1913. Expanse was the fifth town on the C.P.R. line south of the City of  Moose Jaw . It was the end of the C.P.R. track for the south part of the Province from July 1912 until 1914. As an “end of Track”  Boom Town ,  homesteaders  got supplies and brought grain to Expanse from as far south as the United States  Border . The Village of Expanse was disorganized as a village in 1935.
