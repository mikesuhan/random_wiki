Emilio Dandolo  (5 July 1830,  Varese  â€“ 20 February 1859,  Milan ) was an important figure in the Italian  Risorgimento , participating in several of its most important battles. [1]

Originating from a family which produced several other figures involved in the  Italian Wars of Independence , Emilio Dandolo was one of the protagonists in the  Five Days of Milan  (1848) beside his brother  Enrico  and their friends  Luciano Manara  and  Emilio Morosini .

He took part (with the Lombard volunteers) in the  Legione Manara  in the  Brescian  and  Trentine  campaigns of the  First Italian War of Independence . The next year, 1849, he and Enrico participated in the formation of the  Roman Republic  and then defended it with the Battaglione Bersaglieri Lombardi, commanded by  Luciano Manara . He was injured in the riot at the  Villa Corsini  in Rome at which Enrico died.

In the aftermath of the fall of the Roman Republic, he fled into exile first to  Marseilles  and then to  Lugano . During this period Emilio wrote, including "Journey to Egypt, the Sudan, Syria and Palestine" ("Viaggio in Egitto, nel Sudan, in Siria ed in Palestina") and "The volunteers and the Lombard bersaglieri" ("I volontari e i bersaglieri lombardi"). Returning to Italy, he immediately joined preparations for the renewal of hostilities against the  Austrian Empire . He participated in the  Crimean War , but since he was an Austrian citizen he was sent back to Milan, where was put under strict police control. Seriously ill with  consumption , he died in 1859 shortly before Lombardy became free from Austria. His funeral, in Milan, was purged of anti-Austrian connotations and, on the Austrian authorities' dispensation (hoping to avoid riots), he was buried in the cemetery of Adro
