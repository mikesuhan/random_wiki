Estacada High School  is a  public high school  in  Estacada, Oregon , United States.

Estacada High School began in 1905 when 9th and 10th grade classes were taught in the Estacada Grade School, a small building on the west side of Main Street, across from the site of the current elementary school building.

The first Estacada High School graduating class of 1910 consisted of one student. High school age students continued to be taught in the grade school, moving along with the grade school students to a new building that was constructed in 1906 and expanded in 1908, on the site of the current Estacada Grade School.

In 1917, high school aged students moved to a new school, the first Estacada High School, which was built behind the 1906-1908 buildings.

Estacada High School students continued to attend school at this site until the fall of 1936 when, at the end of the first semester, students moved into the newly constructed Estacada High School, the building known today as the Estacada Junior High. During this time, graduating classes varied in size from 25 to 44 students.

The current high school was opened in the fall of 1961, and accommodated a senior class that had grown to 80 students. The entire grade 9 to 12 enrollment had reached 394 students.

Since its construction and a major remodel in 1981, Estacada High School has undergone many changes.

In 2008, 69% of the school's seniors received a  high school diploma . Of 200 students, 138 graduated, 48 dropped out, nine received a  modified diploma , and five were still in high school as of June 2009. [4] [5]
