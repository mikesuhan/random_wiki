Wakabayashilite  is a rare  arsenic ,  antimony   sulfide mineral  with formula [(As,Sb) 6 S 9 ][As 4 S 5 ]. [3]

Wakabayashilite is a rare mineral first discovered in Nevada in the 1920s, but it was mistaken for a hair orpiment. [4]  In the 1970s, wakabayashilite was found in Japan and scientifically identified as a new mineral. [5]  It was named after  Yaichiro Wakabayashi  (1874â€“1943), a Japanese mineralogist of the Mitsubishi Mining Company in Japan. [1]  Wakabayashilite has been discovered later in several places around the world such as in Saha Republic (Russia), Zhuang region (China) and Hautes-Alpes (France). In the United States, Wakabayashilite has be found at the White Caps Mine, Nye County, Nevada. Originally, Wakabayashilite was found in druses of quartz associated with  orpiment  and  realgar , however, it was later found embedded in  calcite  as well. [3]  Generally, it mostly occurs with other arsenic minerals in high-arsenic gold deposits. [5]

Even though Wakabayashilite possesses the hexagonal pseudosymmetry, it actually belongs to the  orthorhombic   crystal system  meaning it contains three axes of different length but are mutually perpendicular to one another. [3] [6]  It also belongs to the  space group  Pna2 1 . [3]  For its optical properties, Wakabayashilite is a  biaxial mineral  and its color in plane polarized light is golden-yellow to lemon-yellow and it also has strong pleochroism. [2]

For now, since wakabayashilite is rare, it is of no obvious economical interest. However, there have been some recent research conducted on its interesting structure, pseudosymmetry and twinning.
