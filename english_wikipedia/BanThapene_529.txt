Ban Thapene  is a village of Luang Prabang district,  Luang Prabang province ,  Laos . This village was first established about 130 years ago [1]  by Kha Hok [2]  families, one of the  Khmu  ethnic sub-groups. Like many other upland inhabitants in Luang Prabang province, the livelihood [3]  and culture of  ethnic groups  such as  Lao Loum , Kha Hok,  Yao  and  Hmong  in Ban Thapene is closely associated with  natural resources .

Ban Thapene is about 29 kilometers southwest from Luang Prang World heritage City. Topography of Ban Thapene is made up of mountains, small valeys, streams and  waterfalls  with elevation ranging between 450â€“930 metres above sea level. The village is adjacent with Ban U and Nong Heo villages to the north, Ban  Khokmanh  and Pa Si villages to the west,  Ban Yang  village to the south and Long Lao Kau and Long Lao May villages to the east. [1]

Ban Thapene is home to families of multi-ethnic groups such as Lao Loum, Kha Hok, Yao and Hmong. In December 2016, Ban Thapene had 139 households with 637 peoples, in which, Kha Hok and Lao Loum are majority. [1]

Total natural area of Ban Thapene which was legitimized by local authorities with support of SPERI and CCFD in 2016 is approximately 1,775.59 ha. This area includes different categories of forest and land e.g. community spirit preserve forestland, [4]  community protected forestland, [5]   community  and family usage forestland,  agricultural land , housing and infrastructure land (e.g.  primary school ,  clinic  and  Wat ), toursim land and military land.

Ban Thapene has an inter-connection of  groundwate r, small streams and  waterfall . The 60 meters height Kuang Si Falll is a part of the Huoi Si stream, which has its source in the Phu Nam Ork Mount within  Luang Prabang Range . Here is  habitat  to wild  bee  species and different types of diverse  deciduous  and (semi) evergreen  plants. The Huoi Si stream flows through Nam Uok and Thapene villages before joining into the  Mekong River .

Natural resources, notably forests play a vital role to the material and  spiritual values  of the ethnic groups in Ban Thapene. Forest and land, especially the spirit forests [6]  like Nam Ork Mount and Hua Tat Mount, are spaces for ethnic groups in Ban Thapene to practice their customary beliefs [7]  via yearly and seasonal  ceremonies  to worship the nature spirit. [8]  Ban Thapene has established its community regulation based on customary law [9]  and government policies in order to preserve such  livelihood  and cultural sites for future generations.

Before 1994, the livelihood [3]  of families in Ban Thapene was largely based on natural resources, upland farming [10] [11]  or rotational  shifting cultivation , [12]  planting  wet rice , raising cows and buffalows, and collecting  non-timber forest products  (NTFPs). Afterward, because of the Lao policy of banning shifting cultivation [13]  and establishing protected areas [14] [15]  to preserve the Kuang Si watershed and develop the Kuang Si tourism area, the above-mentioned traditional practices have been partly converted to small-scale tourism services near the  Kuang Si Falls . By 2014, some families in Ban Thapene still keep plots for  farming . Ban Thapene plans these plots into the community managed area for agricultural production. [1]  Besides the regular income generated from tourism services, villagers also make items e.g. traditional brocade, clothing, baskets, and wooden arts for selling as souvenirs to tourists. These products are largerly made from  NTFPs  collected from community use forests [5]  and family  forests  after the  fallow  period.
