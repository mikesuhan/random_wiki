The  black harrier  ( Circus maurus ) is a medium-sized African  harrier  whose range extends from  South Africa  to  Botswana  and  Namibia .

It has a wingspan of 105–115 cm (41–45 in) and a body length of 44–50 cm (17–20 in). [2]

When perched, this bird appears all black. However, in flight a white rump and flight feathers become visible. Its morphology is comparable to that of other harriers, with a slim body, narrow wings and a long tail. Male and female plumages are similar. Juveniles have buff under-parts and heavily spotted breasts.

Like other harriers it nests on the ground in tall vegetation. Three to five eggs are laid and incubated 35 days.

It feeds mostly on small rodents and birds and will occasionally take reptiles, catching them while flying low over its hunting grounds.

The greatest number of breeding pairs can be found in the  Western Cape  province, South Africa. In this area loose colonies aggregate around coastal wetlands. Breeding in Namibia is suspected but not confirmed.

The black harrier population has declined in recent years to fewer than 1000 birds, and it is now classified as vulnerable, despite still having a wide breeding range. This is due to the destruction of its original breeding habitat, South Africa's natural shrubland, the  fynbos , which has been greatly reduced by encroaching cereal culture and urban expansion.
