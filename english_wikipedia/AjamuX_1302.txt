Ajamu X  (born Huddersfield, 1963) is a British artist, curator, archivist and activist. He best known for his fine art photography, which explores same-sex desire and the Black male body, and his work as an archivist and activist to document the lives and experiences of black  LGBTQ  people in the  UK .

Ajamu was born in 1963 in  Huddersfield  to  Jamaican  parents. His grandparents arrived to England in 1958 and his parents followed in 1962. [1]

Ajamu came out as gay to his parents in his late teens and describes their reaction as "impressively progressive for the times".  [1]  He studied Black History and photography in  Leeds . While in Leeds he and two friends, created the magazine  BLAC , an acronym for Black Liberation Activist Core. In October 1987, after seeing it advertised in the newspaper  Caribbean Times , Ajamu attended the first, and only, National Black Gay Men's Conference held at the  Black Lesbian and Gay Centre  in Camden. By January the following year, he had moved to London. [2] [3]  He was given the name Ajamu in 1991; it means "he who fights for what he believes". [1]

My name Ajamu X is a reference to  Malcolm X  who was my first key role model. Changing my name to an African one was very significant.

Ajamu's work often highlights stories of black LGBT individuals who he feels are often marginalized from mainstream British Society; additionally he has chosen to focus on those who are black and openly "out" and have been accepted by their families. Ajamu has said he rejects the claim that Jamaican culture is particularly homophobic and believes that homophobia exists across cultures and families of all backgrounds. [1]

He often speaks of his work as a "sex activist"; he has run "sex parties for men who want to have sex with men" since the 1990s, [1]  and same-sex desire and pleasure are recurring themes in his photography. His first major exhibition  Black Bodyscapes , in 1994, focused on the private sexual realities of black gay men. [4]  More recent projects include  Fierce: Portraits of Young Black Queers . an exhibition of 24 portraits of a "â€¦new generation of Black and proudly out young, emerging and established talent" [5]  at London's  Guildhall Art Gallery  in 2014 [6]  and  I Am For You Can Enjoy [7]  with Khalil West, at  Contact Theatre ,  Manchester , in 2016, which uses photography and video, to explore the lives of  queer  Black male sex workers and their clients. Ajamu has described himself as an "artist who has created an rchive"  [8]  and, in addition to his art practice, continues to document black LGBT experiences.

In 2000 Ajamu and  Topher Campbell  co-founded  rukus! Federation [9]  an " arts company dedicated to celebrating and showcasing the best in challenging, provocative works by black lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans-gender artists nationally and internationally." [2]  Ajamu was the Archive Manager "The Black LGBT Archive Project", a major initiative to develop an archive collection on "Black Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Trans-Gender heritage, history and lived experience in the UK". [2]  In 2008 Ajamu co-curated the exhibition  Outside Edge: a journey through Black lesbian and gay history  at the  Museum of Docklands . [10]  The  rukus! Black Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Cultural Archive  was deposited at  London Metropolitan Archives  in 2010. [11]

Ajamu was the subject of Topher Campbell's first film  The Homecoming: A Short Film about Ajamu  in 1995 . [12]  The documentary film  Brixton Recreation with Ajamu,  directed by Danny Solle, featured his experiences of cruising and sex as a out Black gay man in Brixton. [13]
