The  Bangladesh Amateur Radio League  ( BARL ) is a national  non-profit organization  for  amateur radio  enthusiasts in  Bangladesh . BARL is the national member society representing Bangladesh in the  International Amateur Radio Union , which it joined in 1982. [2]

Amateur radio activities in  East Pakistan  were suspended during the war with  India  in 1965, and the ban on amateur radio activities remained in effect after Bangladesh achieved independence from  Pakistan  in 1971. The Bangladesh Amateur Radio League was founded on May 20, 1979 by radio enthusiasts and immediately began lobbying the government for approval of amateur radio operation in the country. Efforts to legalize amateur radio in Bangladesh would not succeed until 1991, when a new  democratically  elected government faced a telecommunications emergency during a major  cyclone . Persuaded of the value amateur radio could offer Bangladesh society, amateur radio was legalized in the country, with many restrictions, on August 29, 1991. [3]   Amateur radio license  examinations and license grants were suspended by the government in 2004. Representatives of the Bangladesh Amateur Radio League lobbied the  Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission  to reinstate the examinations and licensing process, which was resumed on August 13, 2008.
