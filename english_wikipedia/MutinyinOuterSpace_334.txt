Mutiny in Outer Space  is a 1965 science fiction film starring  William Leslie  and  Dolores Faith . A space station is overrun by an alien fungus found on the moon.

Exploring ice caves on the moon, crew members carry a strange fungus back to their space station. After a meteor strike disables the station, the fungus begins to overrun the ship.

As TV Guide described, "By the time of the film's release, space travel was less mysterious than it had been in the genre's heyday 10 years before. Thus this routine fare, with standard production values and acting, was simply too late to stir up much interest." [1]
