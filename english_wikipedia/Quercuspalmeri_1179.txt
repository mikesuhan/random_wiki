Quercus palmeri  is a species of  oak  known by the common name  Palmer oak , or  Palmer's oak . It is native to  California ,  Baja California ,  New Mexico , and in  Arizona  through the  transition zone  to the eastern  Mogollon Rim , where it grows in canyons, mountain slopes, washes, and other dry habitat types. [2] [3] [4]

Quercus palmeri  is a  shrub  or small tree growing up to 3 meters (10 feet) tall, but known to reach 6 meters (20 feet) at times. It branches into angular twigs and is reddish brown. The leaves are 1 to 3 centimeters (0.4-1.2 inches) in length. They are stiff, leathery, and brittle, their edges wavy with sharp spine-teeth. The upper surface is shiny, waxy, and olive green in color, the lower gray-green and coated with glandular hairs. The fruit is an  acorn  with a hairy cap up to 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) wide and a blunt-ended nut 2 to 3 centimeters (0.8-1.2 inches) long. [3]

Quercus palmeri  usually grows in small populations, some of which are actually  cloned  growths of a single plant. [3]  One such clone in the  Jurupa Mountains  in  Riverside County, California , named the  Jurupa Oak , was determined to be over 13,000 years old, a single individual living as a  relict  from the  Pleistocene . [5]  It is therefore one of the  oldest living plants in the world .
