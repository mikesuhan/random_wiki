He was born in  Ham-Nord, Quebec , the son of Alfred Demers and Rose Anna Dufresne, and was educated in  Victoriaville . [1]  In 1912, his father and mother moved to  Debden, Saskatchewan ; they were one of the first families to settle in the area. They convinced Omer and his brother Adelbert to move to Debden. The two brothers arrived with a  boxcar  full of supplies and, soon after arriving, built a store which included living quarters. In 1914, Omer married Lucienne Larose. With his business going well, he soon built a larger store and residence. Demers helped open the first school in the town in 1915 and helped establish a  Catholic parish .
