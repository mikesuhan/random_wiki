Stephen K. Doig  is an American journalist, professor of journalism at  Arizona State University , and a consultant to print and broadcast news media with regard to data analysis investigative work. Doig moved to the university in 1996 after 23 years as a newspaper journalist, 19 of them with  The Miami Herald . As of 2010, he taught classes in precision journalism, reporting public affairs, news writing, multimedia journalism, introduction to newsroom statistics, and media research methods.

Doig was a pioneer in the use of computer-assisted data analysis by reporters. For example, he was  Miami Herald  research editor when  Hurricane Andrew  struck  South Florida  in 1992. Analysis of property damages and local government building records showed that newer structures were more likely to have been damaged by the storm, and the team argued that easing the zoning, inspection, and building codes had caused greater storm losses, largely in a 16-page article "What Went Wrong". The newspaper won next year's  Pulitzer Prize for Public Service  citing its coverage "that not only helped readers copeÂ ... but also showed how lax zoning, inspection and building codes had contributed to the destruction."

Doig's analysis of voting patterns in Florida in led him to believe that had there been no errors in vote counting in Florida during the 2000 U.S. presidential election,  Democratic Party  candidate  Al Gore  would have won the state's electoral votes instead of  Republican Party  candidate, and, thereby, the ultimate winner of the U.S. Presidency,  George W. Bush . [4]

In 1990 the  Committee for Skeptical Inquiry  (CSICOP) awarded Doig the  Responsibility in Journalism  award for his work as a Science Editor for the  Miami Herald . [5]
