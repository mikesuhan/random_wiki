The  Mooney TX-1  or  Mooney MT-20  was a prototype American military basic  training aircraft  of the 1980s. It was a two-seat derivative of  Mooney's  popular  M20  light aircraft, but was unsuccessful, only a single example being built.

In late 1982 [1]  the Mooney Aircraft Company of  Kerrville, Texas  flew a prototype of a two-seat military trainer aircraft, the Mooney TX-1. This was based on its popular  Mooney M20 K four seat light aircraft, but with side-by-side seating for pilot and instructor under a sliding canopy. It was an all-metal low-winged  monoplane  with retractable  tricycle landing gear  powered by a single Continental O-360  piston engine  driving a two-blade propeller. [2]  The TX-1 was aimed at the basic trainer market, also being suitable for weapons training and light attack missions, [2]  and so was fitted with four  hardpoints  under the wing. [3]

Mooney stated that they needed orders for 100 aircraft to launch production of the TX-1, [2]  but these did not occur, and no production followed. [1]  The prototype's  aircraft registration  was cancelled in 1989. [4]
