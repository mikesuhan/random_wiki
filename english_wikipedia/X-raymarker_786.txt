X-ray Markers , also known as: anatomical side markers, [1]   Pb  markers,  lead  markers,  x-ray  lead markers, or radiographic film identification markers, are used to mark x-ray films, both in  hospitals  and in industrial workplaces (such as on  aeroplane  parts and  motors ). They are used on radiographic images to determine anatomical side of body, date of the procedure, and may include patients name.

Most X-ray markers consist of a right and a left letter with the  radiographer's  initials. There are also available markers to indicate positioning of the body e.g. supine, or as to time when performing procedures such as an  Intravenous pyelogram .

It has been suggested that radiographic markers are a potential  fomite  for harmful bacteria such as  MRSA , and that they should be cleaned on a regular basis; this, however, is not always done. [2]

Some X-ray markers are created with cartoon pictures or glitter included on the markers. This style marker, known as  maxmarkers , indicate right or left side and include a technologists initials. More importantly a tacky substance, Handi-Tak is used to hold these markers to the X-ray plate during imaging. This Tacky tape should be cleaned between uses and discarded when visibly soiled.
