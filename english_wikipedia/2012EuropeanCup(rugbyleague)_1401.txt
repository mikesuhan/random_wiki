The  2012 European Cup , known as the  Alitalia   European Cup  for sponsorship purposes, is a  rugby league football  tournament. [1]

Four teams competed in the 2012 event, with teams to be decided in November 2011 following the  Four Nations . These were announced as Ireland, Scotland, Italy and the England Knights. [2]

In mid-2012, Italy had to withdraw from the competition due to travel commitments and were omitted from the league to leave 3 teams:- England Knights, Ireland and Scotland.

As they won both of their games the  England Knights  won the Alitalia European Cup and thus became European Champions. This would be England Knights 1st European Championship. However  England  have won 14 times.
