Defence costs  are the cost that are incurred in the defence of a criminal trial in  England  and  Wales . Should a  defendant  be  acquitted  they will almost always be awarded their defence costs.

Defence costs will arise when a defendant is privately represented in a  criminal  matter. To be privately represented means that the defence will not be covered by  legal aid . This tends to be because the defendant in question is wealthy.

Defence costs will be assessed by a taxation master at the conclusion of most successful criminal  trials . Defendants will only be entitled to the proportion of their costs that are found to be reasonable.
