Motown Remixed  is a 2005 compilation album containing  remixed  versions of  Motown  hits, released on May 24, 2005 by Motown/ Universal Records .

Several  hip hop  and  dance  producers, including  Z-Trip ,  DJ Jazzy Jeff ,  the Randy Watson Experience ,  Salaam Remi , Groove Boutique (aka DJ  Rafe Gomez  and David Baron), and  Easy Mo Bee , took hit records by  the Jackson 5 ,  the Temptations ,  the Supremes , and others, and re-imagined them in new styles. The Jackson 5's " ABC ", for example, is re-imagined by Salaam Remi as a  crunk  song, Smokey Robinson's  Quiet Storm  is presented by Groove Boutique as a lush, chilled out jazzy jam, and  Tranzition  takes  the Supremes ' up-tempo "My World is Empty Without You" and transforms it into a  ballad .

The  iTunes Music Store  version has several additional remixes in the album. Furthermore, the UK, European and Australian releases each have a few remixes that were not included on the US edition and are marked with an asterisk [*] below. An accompanying compilation,  Motown Unmixed , features each track in its original version.

In 2007, a follow up album  Motown Remixed, Volume 2  was released.
