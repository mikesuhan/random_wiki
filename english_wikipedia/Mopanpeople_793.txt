The  Mopan  are one of the  Maya peoples  in  Belize  and  Guatemala . Their indigenous language is also called  Mopan  and is one of the  Yucatec Maya languages .

In the 18th and 19th centuries, the British forced the Mopan out of Belize and into Guatemala. [3]  There they endured forced labour and high taxation. [3]  In the late 19th century, many Guatemalan Mopan fled back into Belize, settling in the  Toledo District  in the southern part of the country. [3] [4]

In the 2010 Census, 10,557 Belizeans reported their ethnicity as Mopan Maya. This constituted approximately 3% of the population. [1]
