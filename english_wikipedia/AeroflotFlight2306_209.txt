Aeroflot Flight 2306  was a scheduled domestic passenger flight from  Vorkuta  to Moscow in the  Soviet Union , with a  stopover  in  Syktyvkar . The  Tupolev Tu-134  operated by  Aeroflot  crashed on 2 July 1986 during an  emergency landing  after it departed Syktyvkar, killing 54 of 92 passengers and crew on board. [1]

While it was climbing away from  Syktyvkar , at an altitude of 5,600 metres (18,400 ft), the aircraft's rear  cargo hold  smoke alarm  annunciated . The captain sent the flight engineer to verify the alert. Violating procedure, the captain left the cockpit to investigate with the flight engineer. Having returned to the cockpit, the captain dispatched the first officer to extinguish the fire. The captain then initiated an emergency descent and return to Syktyvkar—which by that time was at a distance of 140 kilometres (87 mi)—from an altitude of 6,700 metres (22,000 ft). [1]  During the emergency descent the captain and the navigator were in the  cockpit , while the flight engineer and the first officer fought the fire. [1]  When the aircraft was at an altitude of 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) the flight engineer and the first officer returned to the cockpit and announced that the fire had not been extinguished, although two  fire extinguishers  had been deployed. [1]  The captain decided to make an immediate  forced landing  and informed  air traffic control  of his decision. [1]  The smoke in the  aircraft cabin  induced coughing, suffocation and bleeding from the  nasopharynx . [1]  Some of the passengers fainted. [1]

The aircraft landed in a dense  mixed forest , 75 kilometres (47 mi) away from Syktyvkar. [1]  The aircraft broke up as a result of impact with trees and was destroyed by fire. [1]

The aircraft was a  Tupolev Tu-134 A, registration CCCP-65120 and manufactured in 1978. [1] [2]  At the time of the crash the aircraft had 7,989 flight cycles and 13,988 flight hours. [1]
