Popov  is a  crater  on the  far side  of the  Moon , just beyond the eastern limb. It is located along the very edge of the area of surface that is sometimes brought into view of the  Earth  during periods of favorable  libration  and illumination. However even at such times it is not prominent and can only be viewed edge-on.

This crater lies due south of  Dziewulski , and the crater chain designated Catena Dziewulski passes just to the northeast of Popov's outer rim. Just to the southeast of Popov lies  MÃ¶bius , and the two are joined together by a smaller crater that lies along the south-southeast rim of Popov. To the southwest lies the crater  Ginzel  and  Mare Marginis .

Popov is a worn crater with a damaged outer rim that is little more than a circular, jumbled series of ridges in the surface. Several small craterlets lie along the rim and inner wall, particularly along the western side. The interior floor is otherwise relatively level and nearly without any features.

It is named after Russian physicist  Alexander Stepanovich Popov , who is considered to be the  inventor of radio  in his homeland and eastern European countries. The asteroid  3074 Popov  is also named after him. [2] [3]

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Popov.
