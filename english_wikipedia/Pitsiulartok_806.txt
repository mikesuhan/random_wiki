Pitsiulartok  or  Pituilaktok  (formerly:  Fairway Island ), [1]  is a small, uninhabited island located at 63°15'N, 90°33'W [2]  in Hudson Bay, about 13 km [3]  from the community of  Chesterfield Inlet, Nunavut ,  Canada . The narrow island is about 3.5 km in length and barely 1 km wide at its widest point. Traditionally it was a walrus-hunting ground for the local  Inuit , [2]  and a landmark for southern  whalers . [4]  It is part of a loose chain of small islands running along the coast, including Sakpik Island and  Promise Island .

The name "Pituilaktok" comes from the Inuktitut name for a local bird known in English as the  black guillemot  ( cepphus grylle ), "pitiula". [5]
