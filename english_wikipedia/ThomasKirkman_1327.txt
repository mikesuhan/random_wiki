Thomas Penyngton Kirkman   FRS  (31 March 1806 â€“ 3 February 1895) was a British mathematician and ordained minister of the  Church of England . Despite being primarily a churchman, he maintained an active interest in research-level mathematics, and was listed by  Alexander Macfarlane  as one of ten leading 19th-century British mathematicians. [1] [2] [3]  In the 1840s, he obtained an existence theorem for  Steiner triple systems  that founded the field of  combinatorial design  theory, while the related  Kirkman's schoolgirl problem  is named after him. [4] [5]

Kirkman was born 31 March 1806 in  Bolton , in the north west of England, the son of a local cotton dealer. In his schooling at the Bolton Grammar School, he studied classics, but no mathematics was taught in the school. He was recognised as the best scholar at the school, and the local vicar guaranteed him a scholarship at Cambridge, but his father would not allow him to go. Instead, he left school at age 14 to work in his father's office. [1] [2] [3]

Nine years later, defying his father, he went to  Trinity College Dublin , working as a private tutor to support himself during his studies. There, among other subjects, he first began learning mathematics. He earned a B.A. in 1833 and returned to England in 1835. [1] [2] [3]

On his return to England, Kirkman was ordained into the ministry of the  Church of England  and became the  curate  in  Bury  and then in  Lymm . In 1839 he was invited to become  rector  of  Croft with Southworth , a newly founded parish in  Lancashire , where he would stay for 52 years until his retirement in 1892. Theologically, Kirkman supported the  anti-literalist  position of  John William Colenso , and was also strongly opposed to  materialism . He published many tracts and pamphlets on theology, as well as a book  Philosophy Without Assumptions  (1876). [1] [2] [3]

Kirkman married Eliza Wright in 1841; they had seven children. To support them, Kirkman supplemented his income with tutoring, until Eliza inherited enough property to secure their living. The rectorship itself did not demand much from Kirkman, so from this point forward he had time to devote to mathematics. [1] [2]

Kirkman died 4 February 1895 in  Bowdon . His wife died ten days later. [1] [3]

Kirkman's first mathematical publication was in the  Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal  in 1846, on a problem involving  Steiner triple systems  that had been published two years earlier in  The Lady's and Gentleman's Diary  by  Wesley S. B. Woolhouse . [1] [2] [3]  Despite Kirkman's and Woolhouse's contributions to the problem, Steiner triple systems were named after  Jakob Steiner  who wrote a later paper in 1853. [1]  Kirkman's second research paper, in 1848, concerned  pluquaternions .

In 1848, Kirkman published  First Mnemonical Lessons , a book on mathematical  mnemonics  for schoolchildren. It was not successful, and  Augustus de Morgan  criticised it as "the most curious crochet I ever saw". [1] [2] [3]

Next, in 1849, Kirkman studied the  Pascal lines  determined by the intersection points of opposite sides of a  hexagon  inscribed within a  conic section . Any six points on a conic may be joined into a hexagon in 60 different ways, forming 60 different Pascal lines. Extending previous work of Steiner, Kirkman showed that these lines intersect in triples to form 60 points (now known as the Kirkman points), so that each line contains three of the points and each point lies on three of the lines. That is, these lines and points form a  projective configuration  of type 60 3 60 3 . [1]

In 1850, Kirkman observed that his 1846 solution to Woolhouse's problem had an additional property, which he set out as a puzzle in  The Lady's and Gentleman's Diary :

Fifteen young ladies in a school walk out three abreast for seven days in succession: it is required to arrange them daily, so that no two shall walk twice abreast.

This problem became known as  Kirkman's schoolgirl problem , subsequently to become Kirkman's most famous result. He published several additional works on combinatorial design theory in later years. [1] [2] [3]

In 1848 Kirkman wrote "On Pluquaternions and Homoid Products of  n  Squares". [6]  Generalizing the  quaternions  and  octonions , Kirkman called a  pluquaternion  Q a  a representative of a system with  a  imaginary units,  a  > 3. Kirkman's paper was dedicated to confirming Cayley's assertions concerning two equations among triple-products of units as sufficient to determine the system in case  a  = 3 but not  a  = 4. [7]  By 1900 these number systems were called  hypercomplex numbers , and later treated as part of the theory of  associative algebras .

Beginning in 1853, Kirkman began working on  combinatorial enumeration  problems concerning  polyhedra , beginning with a proof of  Euler's formula  and concentrating on simple polyhedra (the polyhedra in which each vertex has three incident edges). He also studied  Hamiltonian cycles  in polyhedra, and provided an example of a polyhedron with no Hamiltonian cycle, prior to the work of  William Rowan Hamilton  on the  Icosian game . He  enumerated   cubic   Halin graphs , over a century before the work of Halin on these graphs. [8]  He showed that every polyhedron can be generated from a pyramid by face-splitting and vertex-splitting operations, and he studied  self-dual polyhedra . [1] [3]

Kirkman was inspired to work in  group theory  by a prize offered beginning in 1858 (but in the end never awarded) by the  French Academy of Sciences . His contributions in this area include an enumeration of the transitive  group actions  on sets of up to ten elements. However, as with much of his work on polyhedra, Kirkman's work in this area was weighed down by newly invented terminology and, perhaps because of this, did not significantly influence later researchers. [1] [3]

In the early 1860s, Kirkman fell out with the mathematical establishment and in particular with  Arthur Cayley  and  James Joseph Sylvester , over the poor reception of his works on polyhedra and groups and over issues of priority. Much of his later mathematical work was published (often in  doggerel ) in the problem section of the  Educational Times  and in the obscure  Proceedings of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Liverpool . [1]  However, in 1884 he began serious work on  knot theory , and with  Peter Guthrie Tait  published an enumeration of the knots with up to ten crossings. [3]  He remained active in mathematics even after retirement, until his death in 1895. [3]

In 1857, Kirkman was elected as a fellow of the  Royal Society  for his research on pluquaternions and partitions. [1]  He was also an honorary member of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester and the Literary and Philosophical Society of Liverpool, and a foreign member of the  Dutch Society of Science .

Since 1994, the  Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications  has handed out an annual Kirkman medal, named after Kirkman, to recognise outstanding combinatorial research by a mathematician within four years of receiving a doctorate.
