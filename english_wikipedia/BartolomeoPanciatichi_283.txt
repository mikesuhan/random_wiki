Bartolomeo Panciatichi  (1507-1582) was an Italian humanist and politician.

He was born in  France , the illegitimate son of the merchant Bartolomeo, who owned the main  Florentine  trade company working in  France , at  Lyon . His father had financed the conquests of  Louis XII of France , and the young Bartolomeo was sent as  page  to the French court of King  Francis I . Later he studied in Lyon and  Padua , leaving the family's commercial activities to his relatives.

He was a friend of Jean de Vauzelles, abbot of  Montrottier , who translated into French the religious works of  Pietro Aretino ; Panciatichi himself sent the first translated copies to the Italian author in  Venice  in 1539. In 1539 he moved to Florence, where, on 20 January 1541, he became a member of the  Accademia degli Umidi . In 1545 duke  Cosimo I de' Medici  appointed him as consul to France. Here Panciatichi became attracted to the  Protestant movement , and later brought to Florence several books which had been forbidden by the Catholic church.

He was one of the 35 people arrested as heretics in Florence in December 1551-January 1552; Panciatichi was later freed in exchange of a ransom. After promising he would no more deal with religious matters, he subsequently restarted his political career under the Medici aegis: in 1567 he became senator, in 1568 he was commissar in  Pisa  and, in 1578, in  Pistoia .
