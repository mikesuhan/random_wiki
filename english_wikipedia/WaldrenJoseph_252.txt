Waldren "Frog" Joseph  (September 12, 1918 â€“ September 19, 2004) was a  jazz   trombone  player from  New Orleans, Louisiana . He played in a variety of styles over his career but was best known as a performer of traditional New Orleans jazz; a style carried on today by the  Preservation Hall  ensembles. His first job as a teenager was playing  piano ,  double bass , and trombone on an excursion boat on  Lake Ponchartrain , and he went on to tour with a range of musicians including  Joe Robichaux ,  Sidney Desvigne , and  Lee Allen . Joseph also recorded with  R&B  artists such as  Big Joe Turner ,  Earl King ,  Smiley Lewis , and  Dave Bartholomew . In the traditional vein, he recorded and toured with New Orleans bandleaders like  Paul Barbarin ,  Louis Cottrell, Jr. , and  Papa French . Late in his life he was a member of the  Original Camelia Band  led by  trumpeter   Clive Wilson .

Joseph was the father of seven children, two of whom went on to become accomplished jazz musicians themselves:  sousaphone  player  Kirk Joseph  and trombonist  Charles Joseph .
