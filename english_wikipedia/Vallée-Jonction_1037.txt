Vallée-Jonction  is a municipality in the  Municipalité régionale de comté de la Nouvelle-Beauce  in  Quebec ,  Canada . It is part of the  Chaudière-Appalaches  region and the population is 1,895 as of 2009.

In 1881, the Lévis and Kennebec Railway opened a train station between  Sainte-Marie  and  Saint-Joseph-de-Beauce  named Beauce-Jonction. When the  Quebec Central Railway  bought it in 1882, Beauce-Jonction became one of the most important train stations on the  Lévis - Sherbrooke  line.

In 1900, the parish of L'Enfant-Jésus was constituted and part of its territory was detached in 1924 to form a village of the same name, but known locally as Beauce-Junction, after the post office opened in 1883. The village changed its name to Vallée-Jonction in 1949. L'Enfant-Jésus and Vallée-Jonction amalgamated in 1989 to form the current municipality.
