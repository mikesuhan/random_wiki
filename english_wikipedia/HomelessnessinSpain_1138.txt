Homelessness in Spain  is a significant social issue, affecting some 40,000 people. [1]  Migrants are disproportionately represented among the homeless population. [2]  Young people are also highly represented among the homeless, some studies estimating that 30% of Spain's homeless are aged 18-29. [3]  Some researchers maintain that  street children  are increasingly common as well. [4]

Mental illness among homeless is thought to occur less frequently than the US, this may be attributed to Spain's universal healthcare system. [5]  One study found high levels of substance-related disorders, but these rates were comparatively lower than US and UK samples. [6]  Other researchers note that such comparative studies run the challenge of lack of prepared official definition of homelessness, as well as few well-controlled studies. [7]

in 2015, a former minister and leader of the conservative Popular Party stated that homeless people sleeping in the streets are “scaring off” tourists from Madrid. [8]
