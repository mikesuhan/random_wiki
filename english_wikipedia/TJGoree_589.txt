On the boat from Galveston, Texas to  New Orleans , he met Maj.  James Longstreet , who had resigned his commission in the  United States Army  and was also traveling to  Virginia  to offer his services to the Confederate states. Lt. Goree, who was eventually promoted to captain, served as Longstreet's aide throughout the war and was involved in almost every battle in which Longstreet's corps took part, from  Blackburn's Ford  to  Appomattox . He was never wounded, although he had several horses shot out from under him and his clothing was riddled with bullet holes.

After  Appomattox , Goree accompanied Longstreet home to Alabama. Goree returned to Texas in 1865 and took over operations at the Raven Hill Plantation near Huntsville, which his mother had purchased in 1858. He ran the plantation and continued to practice law until 1869.
