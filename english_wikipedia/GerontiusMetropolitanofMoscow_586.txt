Gerontius  ( Геронтий  in Russian) (died 1489) was  Metropolitan of Moscow  from 1473 until 1489 and a writer. Gerontius was the Bishop of  Kolomna . In 1473, he was appointed  Metropolitan  of Moscow. In the late 1470s, he was in conflict with  Ivan III , among other things, over the consecration procedures of the new churches. During the  Great standing on the Ugra river  in 1480, Gerontius spoke for resisting the  Golden Horde  to the very end. He adhered to a moderate position in dealing with  heresies , which had already plagued Moscow and  Novgorod . In 1482, Gerontius left his post, though he would later return at the request of the  Grand Prince .
