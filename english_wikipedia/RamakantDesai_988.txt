Ramakant Bhikaji Desai     pronunciation   ( help · info )  (20 June 1939,  Bombay  – 28 April 1998, Mumbai) represented  India  in  Test cricket  as a  fast bowler .

Ramakant Desai was an Indian fast bowler, who stood less than 5 feet 6 inches in height. His size earned him the nickname 'Tiny'. He made his Test debut against  West Indies  in 1958-59 took 4/169 in 49 overs. He troubled the batsmen with bouncers, which was unusual for an Indian bowler at the time.

He toured  England  in 1959, West Indies in 1961-62 and Australia and New Zealand in 1967-68. Against  Pakistan  in 1960-61, he took 21 wickets in the series. At  Bombay , he scored a quick 85 batting at No.10, an Indian record, and added a record 149 for the ninth wicket with  Nana Joshi . His best bowling performance in Tests was 6 for 56 against  New Zealand  at Bombay in 1964-65. At  Dunedin  in 1967-68 his jaw was fractured by a ball from  Dick Motz , despite which he added 57 runs for the last wicket with  Bishen Bedi .  [2]

In his first year in the  Ranji Trophy , he took 50 wickets in 7 matches at an average of 11.10. [1]  It is still a record for  Bombay . It included a performance of 5 for 10 and 6 for 28 against  Saurashtra . [2]  In the Ranji Trophy final in 1960-61 he took 7 for 46 and 4 for 74 in Bombay's victory over  Rajasthan . [3]  Two years later, also against Rajasthan in the final, he scored his only first-class century, 107, in another victory. [4]  In his 11 years in the Bombay team (1958-59 to 1968-69), he never finished in a losing side.

As the only bowler of pace in the Indian team, he was perennially overworked. When Desai retired from regular first-class cricket after the 1968-69 season, when still only 29 years old, P.N. Sundaresan wrote that he "bowled his heart out on the dead pitches in India ... A more judicious use of his talent both in the Ranji Trophy and other matches could have preserved him as a penetrating bowler for a longer period." [5]

Desai was the chairman of selectors from 1996-97. He resigned the post a month before his death. He died four days after being admitted in a hospital for a cardiac arrest.
