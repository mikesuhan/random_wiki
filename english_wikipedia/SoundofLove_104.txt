Sound of Love  is a  live album  by jazz drummer  Paul Motian  recorded at the  Village Vanguard  in 1995 and on the  Winter & Winter  label in 1997. [1]

The Penguin Guide to Jazz  selected this album as part of its suggested Core Collection. [2]

The  AllMusic  review by Stephen Cook awarded the album 4Â½ stars calling it "a stellar set of jazz covers and Motian originals" and noting "As the premium sound quality of the recording makes clear, this trio had an almost telepathic rapport on stage, inspiring each other in both ensemble playing and solo flights. This kind of hand-in-glove chemistry is certainly due in part to the group's many stints on the road, but also comes from the individual player's complimentary [ sic ] styles". [3]
