Sheng Maoye  (Sheng Mao-yeh, traditional: 盛茂燁, simplified: 盛茂烨); was a  Chinese   landscape painter  during the  Ming Dynasty  (1368–1644). His specific dates of birth and death are unknown.

Sheng was born in  Suzhou  in  Jiangsu  province, where he made his reputation and career. [1]  His  sobriquet  was 'Nian An'. Sheng's landscapes have a foggy and spacious atmosphere, and often suggest a pervasive nostalgia in a fin-de-siècle Suzhou.
