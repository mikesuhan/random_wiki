Feodor Ivanovich Pryanishnikov  ( Russian :  Фёдор Иванович Прянишников ; 2 February 1793 – 28 April 1867) was a Russian  actual privy councillor  and  postal  administrator. At the height of his career (1857–1863), F. I. Pryanishnikov ultimately run the Russian postal department on an equal footing with ministers. [1]

In 1824, F. I. Pryanishnikov joined the Postal Department of the Russian Empire. He worked under the Department's Commander-in-Chief Prince Alexander Golitsyn. The Russian  Tsar   Nicholas I  wanted to reform the department. He asked Golitsyn to study postal systems of Prussia and Great Britain. Pryanishnikov knew English, and Golitsyn sent him abroad. Pryanishnikov did this task in May 1827 to June 1828. In Britain, he wished to get access to information about the Post Office service. His request was examined by the  General Post Office  and  Foreign Office  and refused. Eventually, the  Postmaster General  met Pryanishnikov's request. On 14 November 1827, the Post Office notified the Foreign Office that Praynishnikov was allowed to get such information. [1]

When Pryanishnikov came back to Russia, he wrote a detailed report. It included proposals for reforms. The report was given to a special committee. One of its members was  Konstantin Bulgakov . After examination, the report and proposals were submitted to the Tsar. He approved them. In 1830, the postal reforms were started. In 1831, Pryanishnikov replaced Bulgakov as Director of St. Petersburg Post Office. [1]

In 1842, Golitsyn gave up supervision of the Russian Postal Department. The Tsar replaced him with Count  V. F. Adlerberg  ( other languages )  (1791–1884). Adlerberg was a close friend of the Tsar and one of his adjutants since 1817. Pryanishnikov was appointed as Director of the Postal Department. In 1852, Adlerberg was to become Minister of the Imperial Court. But he continued to head the Postal Department until 1857. Because of health reasons, Pryanishnikov had to give up work in 1854. However, he was asked in 1857 to take up the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Postal Department. He was directly subordinated to Nicholas' successor,  Alexander II . [1]

Feodor Pryanishnikov retired in 1863. He died four years later after a long illness. [1]

After Bulgakov's death, Pryanishnikov continued his work of improving the postal services. Town post was organised in St. Petersburg in 1835 followed by similar services in Moscow (in 1844) and other cities. In 1843, a uniform  postage  rate was introduced that equaled 10 silver  kopecks  for 1  lot . In 1845, the town posts began using  stamped envelopes , and this innovation was extended throughout Russia in 1848. Mail boxes were introduced in 1848. [1]

Under Pryanishnikov, the first  Russia's postage stamp , with face value of 10 kopecks, went on sale to the public at the end of December 1857. The steamship services started under Bulgakov were further developed. In 1838, mail transportation by rail began on the Russia's first railway between St. Petersburg and Tsarskoe Selo. In 1851, the first mail-coaches appeared on the newly opened railway service between St. Petersburg and Moscow, and this also enabled the electric telegraph. Subscription for newspapers and journals was offered via postal service. Post offices were subject to modernisation. Overall, the postal department essentially expanded in the size. In addition, postal treaties with Austria (1843), Greece (1848), Prussia (1843), and Sweden (1846) were signed by Pryanishnikov. [1]

By the end of Pryanishnikov's service and retirement in 1863, the improvements and modernisation of Russia's postal system were in good progress. These developments coincided with the beginning of the reign of Alexander II and were supposed to go on for the rest of the century. However, internal political situation within Russia during the late 1860s and 1870s became less favourable. The Postal Directorate began losing its pace of development as an independent government agency, and was subordinated to the control of the Ministry of the Interior. No significant organisational changes of the Russian postal service occurred until the revolutions of 1917. [1]
