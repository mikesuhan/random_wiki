The  Hope Valley Reservoir  is a 2.84-gigalitre (620-million-imperial- or 750-million-US-gallon) service  reservoir  in  Hope Valley, South Australia , a suburb of  Adelaide , South Australia. [1]

When completed in 1873 it was the second reservoir constructed in Adelaide; it is the oldest still in use in South Australia. [2]  It covers 52 hectares (128 acres) and is retained behind a 950-metre (3,117Â ft) long clay-cored earth wall. Water is transferred from the  River Torrens  via a tunnel and aqueduct. The river is also used to transfer water from the  Kangaroo Creek  and  Millbrook  reservoirs. [1]
