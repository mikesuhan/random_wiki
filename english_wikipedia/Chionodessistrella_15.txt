Chionodes sistrella  is a  moth  in the  Gelechiidae  family. [1]  It is found in  North America , where it has been recorded from  Alberta ,  Colorado ,  Texas , southern  Nevada ,  Arizona ,  New Mexico ,  California  and  Mississippi . [2] [3]

The  wingspan  is 9–10 mm. The forewings are deep black and pure silvery white, with a broad longitudinal black band in the middle of the wing, equidistant from the costal and dorsal edge, starting at base of the costa and reaching one-half of the length of the wing, where it turns sharply rectangularly upward, reaching the costal edge and thus inclosing a narrow, longitudinal costal white patch. The apical two-fifths are black, with two white large rounded opposite costal and dorsal spots. The rest of the wing have a nearly straight white fascia just outside the middle of the wing. The hindwings are silvery fuscous. [4]  Adults are on wing from March to October. [5]

The larvae feed on  Suaeda fruticosa ,  Suaeda moquini ,  Suaeda torreyana  and  Atriplex semibaccata .
