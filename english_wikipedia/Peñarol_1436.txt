Club Atlético Peñarol  ( Spanish pronunciation:  [kluβ aˈtletiko peɲaˈɾol]  (   listen ) ; English:  Peñarol Athletic Club ) —also known as  Carboneros ,  Aurinegros  and (familiarly)  Manyas — is a Uruguayan sports club from  Montevideo . The name "Peñarol" comes from the  Peñarol neighbourhood  on the outskirts of Montevideo. [3]  Throughout its history the club has also participated in other sports, such as  basketball [4]  and cycling. [5]  Its focus has always been on  football , a sport in which the club excels, [6]  having  never been relegated  from the top division.

In international competition, Peñarol is the third-highest  Copa Libertadores  winner with five victories [7]  and shares the record for  Intercontinental Cup  victories with three. [8]  In September 2009, the club was chosen as the  South American Club of the Century  by the  IFFHS   . [6]

Peñarol was founded on 28 September 1891 when employees of the  Central Uruguay Railway Company  established the  Central Uruguay Railway Cricket Club  (CURCC) of Montevideo, with the purpose of stimulating the practice of  cricket ,  rugby football  and "other male sports" (literal from the Spanish).

The Central Uruguay Railway company had operated in Uruguay since 1878, [3]  with 118 employees, 72 British, 45 Uruguayan and one German. [9]  The club was known as CURCC in the neighborhood of Peñarol—the latter from the  Peñarol  neighborhood, about 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) from  Montevideo , [3]  whose name in turn derived from an  Italian city . The club's first president  Frank Henderson , who remained in that position until 1899. [10]

In 1892, the CURCC shifted its focus from cricket and rugby to association football. [11]  The football club's first game was against a team of students from the English high school and ended with a 2–0 victory. [9]  In 1895, Uruguayan footballer  Julio Negrón  was chosen as the team's first non-British  captain . [12]

In 1900 the CURCC was one of four charter members of the Uruguay Association Football League, [13]  making its debut in official competition on 10 June against  Albion  and winning 2–1. [14]  The club won its first  Uruguayan championship  that year, repeating in  1901 ,  1905  and  1907 . In 1906 Charles W. Bayne took over the railroad, and refused to sponsor the football team due to financial and work issues. Conflict between the company and the football club led to the severance of their relationship in 1913. [15]

In 1908, the club left the Uruguayan league after the league rejected their request to replay a game with F.C. Dublín. CURCC had lost 2–3 on the road, and believed their poor showing was due to refereeing mistakes caused by pressure from rabid home fans. As a sign of good faith, Nacional also retired from the league, since both teams agreed that " Los Partidos se ganan en la Cancha ", or the games are won in the field. [13]  Back in competition the following year, relations between the CUR and the club became frostier after fans burned a train car used for rival teams.

A year after the club's  1911 Uruguayan championship , the club attempted reforms to its policies. Proposals included greater participation by non-CUR players and a name change to "CURCC Peñarol". In June 1913, the proposals were rejected; the company wanted to distance itself from the club's local reputation. The railroad company, decided to separate the " foot-ball " section of the team from the company on Saturday 13 December 1913. That is when Peñarol was founded. The following day it was the first time a " Clasico " was officially played between Nacional and Peñarol. [16]

CURCC kept playing football in the amateurism until it was dissolved on 22 January 1915 and donated all their trophies to the British Hospital of Montevideo, not to Peñarol.

The club was congratulated on its 120th anniversary in September 2011 by presidents  Joseph Blatter ,  Michel Platini . [17]  and  Nicolás Leoz . [18]

On 12 March 1914, Peñarol replaced CURCC's spot in the Uruguayan Football League after its foundation in 1913. A request submitted to the Uruguayan Football League two days later and approved the following day. [9]  During its first years Peñarol was not successful, although a new stadium ( Las Acacias ) opened on 19 May 1916. [19]  The club won its first two league titles in  1918  and  1920 .

In November 1922 the  Asociación Uruguaya de Fútbol  (AUF) disqualified Peñarol because the club played an  exhibition game  with the  Racing Club de Avellaneda , a club affiliated with the  Asociación Amateurs de Football  in Argentina and not the  Asociación Argentina de Football . [20]  Peñarol and other clubs then organised a new league, the  Uruguayan Football Federation  (FUF), and the club won the  1924  championship. [20]  The league was short-lived; Peñarol won the  1926  Copa del Consejo Provisorio, triggering a merger between the AUF and the FUF. [21]

After its first European tour in 1927, Peñarol won the Uruguayan championship in  1928  and  1929 ; the following year, the club defeated  Olimpia  1–0 in its first game at the  Centenario Stadium  in Montevideo.

In 1932, Peñarol and  River Plate  played the first game of the professional era. Peñarol won the first Uruguayan professional championship with 40 points, five more than runners-up  Rampla Juniors . [22]  After placing second in 1933 and 1934, the club won four consecutive league tournaments between  1935  and  1938 ; they also won the 1936 Torneo Competencia.

The club stayed in second place until  1944 , when Peñarol again won the Uruguayan Championship (defeating Nacional in a two-game final, 0–0 and 3–2). [23]  In  1945  the club retained the title, with  Nicolás Falero  and  Raúl Schiaffino  the top goal scorers of the playoffs with 21 apiece. [24]  Peñarol was again victoious in 1949, four points ahead of runner-up Nacional with  Óscar Míguez  the top scorer. [25]

After placing second in 1950, Peñarol won the Uruguayan Championship  the following year ; [26]  this was also the start of the Palacio Peñarol's four-year construction. During the 1950s, the club also won national championships in  1953 , [27]   1954 , [28]   1958 [29]  and  1959 . [30]

Their 1959 championship qualified Peñarol for the recently created  Copa Libertadores , an international competition then known as the Copa de Campeones de América. Peñarol won the first two tournaments, beating  Olimpia  of  Paraguay  in  1960 [31]  and  Palmeiras  of  Brasil  in  1961 . [32]  That year the club won its first  Intercontinental Cup , defeating  Benfica  of Portugal 2–1 in the third game. [33]  Peñarol won three more league titles ( 1960 ,  1961  and  1962 ), for five consecutive championships.

After a quiet year in 1963, Peñarol won the Uruguayan Championship in  1964  and  1965  and the  Copa Libertadores  in  1966 , defeating  River Plate  4–2. [34]  That year the club won its second  Intercontinental Cup , defeating  Real Madrid  2–0 in Centenario Stadium and  Santiago Bernabéu . [35]  During the next few years the club won national championships in  1967  and  1968  and the  Intercontinental Champions' Supercup  in  1969  (a tournament with South American Intercontinental Cup winners). Peñarol had the longest undefeated run in Uruguayan league history: 56 games, from 3 September 1966 to 14 September 1968. [36]  Copa Libertadores all-time top scorer  Alberto Spencer  played for Peñarol at this time.

In 1970 the club again reached the Libertadores final again, losing to  Estudiantes de La Plata . The club set a tournament record for greatest goal difference, defeating  Valencia  of  Venezuela  11–2. With  Fernando Morena  as the team's star, the club won the Uruguayan championship for three consecutive years, from 1973–75. After placing second in 1976 and 1977, Peñarol won again in 1978. That year, Morena set two records: most goals scored in a Uruguayan season (36) [37]  and most goals scored in a single game (seven, against  Huracán Buceo  on 16 July). [38]  The 1970s ended with another championship in 1979. Morena was top scorer in the Uruguayan tournament six straight times, and top  Copa Libertadores scorer in 1974  and  1975 .

After beginning the 1980s with a third-place finish in  1981 , Peñarol won the Uruguayan Championship with Fernando Morena and  Rubén Paz  (the tournament's top scorer). The next season the club again won the Copa Libertadores, defeating  Cobreloa  of  Chile  1–0 on a goal from Fernando Morena [39]  (the tournament's top scorer with seven goals) in the game's final minutes. Later that year the club won the Uruguayan championship and its third Intercontinental Cup, defeating  Aston Villa  2–0. [40]

Despite financial problems during the 1980s, Peñarol won the national championship in  1985  and  1986 , and a fifth  Copa Libertadores  in  1987 . The club defeated  América de Cali  1–0 with a goal by  Diego Aguirre  in the final seconds of extra time, when a tie would have gone to the Colombians on the goal differential. [41]  It was the third Copa Libertadores won by Peñarol at the  Nacional de Chile , following victories in  1966  and  1982 .

Peñarol celebrated its hundredth anniversary in 1991, despite a controversy ignited by archrivals  Nacional  concerning Peñarol's 1913 name change. With  Pablo Bengoechea  and the young  Antonio Pacheco  on the team and  Gregorio Pérez  behind the bench, Peñarol again won the Uruguayan championship five straight times ( 1993 – 97 ). [42]  The club also reached the  Copa Conmebol  final in 1994 and 1995, rounding out the century with a national championship in  1999  (defeating Nacional 2–1 in the final, despite  Julio Ribas  on the bench).

The next year, Peñarol lost the Uruguayan championship final against Nacional; many of the team's players were jailed after a tournament fight. [43]  Peñarol won the national championship again in  2003  for  Diego Aguirre , defeating Nacional in the final. The club did not win another national title until the  2009–10 season , when it won the Clausura tournament with 14 victories in 15 games (12 of them in a row). In the Clausura final, Peñarol defeated Nacional 2–1. The championship qualified the team for the  Libertadores 2011 , where Peñarol reached the  final  with  Santos . [44]

Throughout the club's history minor changes have been made to its symbols, but it has kept its original colors. The shield and flag were designed by architect  Constante Facello  and consist of five black stripes, four yellow stripes and eleven yellow stars on a black background (representing the eleven players). [45]

Since its founding, Peñarol's colors have been yellow and black. They were inspired by the  Rocket locomotive  designed by  George Stephenson , which won an award in 1829. [10]

The first jersey was a plain shirt, divided into four square sections which alternated black and yellow. [46]  A variant had two vertical halves (black on the right and black-and-yellow stripes on the left), with black shorts and socks. Peñarol's official jersey (black and yellow stripes) dates back to 1911 [47]  and has been worn almost continuously, with only slight variations. [48]

The first alternate uniform is believed to have been a squared jersey, similar to the club's first main shirt but with orange instead of yellow. In 1984 a jersey with horizontal stripes (instead of vertical) was worn, and 1987 featured a yellow jersey with black shorts. Other alternate uniforms (used recently) have been completely black, grey or yellow. Special jerseys have been worn for international friendlies, especially during the 1960s. The CURCC's main uniform (with two-halves, one plain and one striped) is used as a third uniform. On 4 February 2013 all-black and all-yellow alternate uniforms were introduced. [49]

Peñarol's stadium is the José Pedro Damiani, also known as  Las Acacias . It was bought in 1913 and inaugurated on 19 April 1916 with a 3–1 victory over Nacional. [51]  The stadium's gate was that of the former  Estadio Pocitos , Peñarol's first stadium where the first goal in the history of the  FIFA World Cup  was scored in  1930 . [52]

The stadium is in the Marconi neighbourhood of Montevideo. Its pitch is of 37,949 square metres (408,480 sq ft), and it has a capacity of 12,000. [51]  Because Peñarol is not allowed to play there, [ why? ] [53]  the club home ground is the city owned Estadio Centenario. Opened on 18 July 1930, the Centenario stadium is located in  Parque Batlle  and can hold 65,235. [54]

On 28 September 2012, the club proposed a 40,000-capacity stadium in the outskirts of Montevideo, about 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) from the  Aeropuerto Internacional de Carrasco . [55]  The name of their newest stadium is  Campeón del Siglo , with the opening in March 2016.

The Palacio Peñarol, in downtown Montevideo, is the club's headquarters and basketball stadium. It was opened on 21 June 1955; [56]  and is located. The Palacio has 3,896 square metres (41,940 sq ft) in addition to basketball, it is home the club's museum and offices. [57]  After the October 2010 collapse of the  Cilindro Municipal , the Palacio Peñarol became an important venue for Uruguayan basketball. [58]

The Complejo Deportivo Washington Cataldi, commonly known as Los Aromos, is a training ground for the main team. [59]  In Villa Los Aromos of Barros Blancos, in the  Canelones  department, Los Aromos was bought in 1945; under the direction of architect José Donato, it was built in two years. [60]

For the club's 118th anniversary, the Centro de Alto Rendimiento was inaugurated. The new facility, which opened on 28 September 2009, includes five football pitches, a weight room and a gymnasium with artificial turf. [61]

The Frank Henderson School, named in honor of the club's first president, is a few kilometers away from the Centro de Alto Rendimiento. It was built to develop the club's young players, and houses those who come from other areas. [62]

In Uruguayan football, loyalty to Peñarol or Nacional divides the country. The clubs are evenly matched, and have a large fan base. Many surveys of public opinion have been conducted, but none have been conclusive. In 1993 the Factum consulting firm reported that Peñarol was the favorite team of 41 percent of football fans, while 38 percent supported Nacional. [12]  Factum conducted another survey in 2006, confirming its previous results: Peñarol with 45 percent and Nacional with 35 percent. [63]

MPC Consultants surveyed 9,000 Uruguayans; Peñarol had 45 percent of the supporters, and Nacional 38 percent. An online survey on the webpage Sportsvs.com showed Nacional with 50.35 percent and Peñarol with 49.45 percent. [64]

Since its formation, Peñarol's  barra brava  has been involved in violence against other clubs and the Uruguayan police. Incidents provoked by these fans have cost Peñarol 31 points since 1994; the penalties cost the team three tournaments ( Apertura 1994 , [65]   Clausura 1997 [66]  and  Clausura 2002 ). [67]

In 2010 the club attempted to increase its fan base to improve its sustainability. During Clausura 2010 promotions were offered, marketing managers hired and the  peñas  (local fan clubs) encouraged. The campaign was successful; in February 2013 the club had over 62,000 members, the largest fan club in Uruguay. [68]

The Uruguayan Derby between Peñarol and  Nacional  goes back to 1900, the oldest football rivalry outside the  British Islands . [69]  The first game ever played between Nacional and CURCC was on 15 July 1900 and ended 2–0 in favor of CURCC. CURCC was ahead at first, but Nacional caught up during the late 1910s. Nacional took the lead by fourteen games in 1948, and would not surrender it until the late 1970s (except briefly in 1968). Since then, Peñarol has been the leader; its longest lead was 26 games in January 2004. [70]  Including the amateur and professional eras, league and friendly games, the teams have met 511 times in the past with 182 victories to Peñarol, 166 to Nacional and 163 ties. [70]

A notable game for Peñarol fans is occurred on 9 October 1949 in the Uruguayan Cup first round, and is known as the  Clásico de la fuga  (the "escape derby"). At the end of the first half Peñarol was leading 2–0, but at halftime Nacional decided not to return. While Peñarol fans believe that Nacional did not want to be defeated by a Peñarol team known as the  Máquina del 49  ("Machine of 49"), Nacional supporters claim it was a protest against poor officiating. [71]

On 23 April 1987 for a friendly game, Peñarol and Nacional were tied 1–1 with 22 minutes remaining when three Peñarol players ( José Perdomo ,  José Herrera  and  Ricardo Viera ) were ejected after a foul and subsequent protests. Peñarol then had to face a full Nacional team with only eight players on the pitch. With eight minutes remaining  Diego Aguirre  set up  Jorge Cabrera , who scored the winning goal. This win by the  aurinegro  was known as the  Clásico de los 8 contra 11  (the "8 against 11 derby"). [72]

Peñarol and Nacional have faced each other in the final game of the  Uruguayan Championship  thirteen times, with Peñarol winning eight. The most recent was in 2015, when Nacional won the championship 2–1. [70]

In early October 2011  Manyas: The Movie , a documentary about Peñarol's fans, was released in Uruguay. Produced by Kafka Films and Sacromonte and directed by  Andrés Benvenuto , the film features interviews with fans, football journalists, psychologists and politicians. [73]   Manyas: The Movie  was deemed of cultural interest by the Culture and Education Ministry of Uruguay and of ministerial interest by Uruguay's Ministry of Tourism and Sport. [73]  The film had the most-successful premiere of any Uruguayan film, [74]  selling 13,000 tickets during its first weekend [75]  and 30,000 over its first fifteen days. [76]

After raising $35,000 in raffles and donations, on 12 April 2011 Peñarol fans unveiled the largest flag ever unfurled in a stadium up to that moment. Nacional unfurled a bigger one years later that covered three stands of the stadium. The flag, 309 metres (1,014 ft) long and 46 metres (151 ft) wide for a surface area of 14,124 square metres (152,030 sq ft), covered one-and-a-half grandstands in Centenario Stadium. [77]  In 2013, Club Nacional de Football displayed a flag which was 600 metres long by 50 metres wide. This is now the world's biggest flag.

Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under  FIFA eligibility rules . Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.

Néstor Gonçalves  has the most official games in the club's history (571 matches, between 28 April 1957 and 28 November 1970. The team's all-time top scorers in the Primera División are Fernando Morena (203),  Alberto Spencer  (113) and  Óscar Míguez  (107). Morena's (whose 230 goals—203 with Peñarol and 27 with  River Plate —make him the highest-scoring player in the Uruguayan League) 440 goals with Peñarol are a record as well. He scored the most goals in a single Uruguayan season (36 in  1978 ), and is the club's second-best goal scorer in international competition with 37 goals (behind  Alberto Spencer , who scored 58 goals between 1960 and 1970). Spencer and Morena are the top scorers in Copa Libertadores history, [78]  with 48 and 37 goals respectively for Peñarol. [note 8]

Peñarol has made a large contribution to the  Uruguayan national football team . Three Peñarol players were on the Uruguayan team which played Argentina in 1905. [79]  Five Peñarol players were on the Uruguayan squad which won the  1930 FIFA World Cup : goalkeeper  Miguel Capuccini , defender  Peregrino Anselmo  and midfielders  Lorenzo Fernández ,  Álvaro Gestido  and  Carlos Riolfo . [80]  Peñarol had nine players on the Uruguayan squad which won the  1950 FIFA World Cup : goalkeeper  Roque Máspoli , defenders  Juan Carlos González  and  Washington Ortuño , midfielders  Juan Alberto Schiaffino  and  Obdulio Varela  and forwards  Ernesto Vidal ,  Julio César Britos ,  Óscar Míguez  and  Alcides Ghiggia . [80]  Schiaffino and Ghiggia scored the team's two goals in the  Maracanazo , the final game against Brasil. [81]  Peñarol is the only club which has represented Uruguay in all its World Cup appearances. [82]

While there is no hard information about managers in the amateur era of Uruguayan football, Peñarol has had a total of 62 coaches during its professional era. The first manager was  Leonardo de Luca , who coached the team for two years and won the Uruguayan Championship (the first professional tournament in Uruguay) in 1932.

Of these 62 managers, 53 were Uruguayan; two were Hungarian ( Emérico Hirschl  and  Béla Guttmann ), two British ( John Harley  and  Randolph Galloway ), one Serbian ( Ljupko Petrović ), two Brazilian ( Osvaldo Brandão  and  Dino Sani ), one from Chile ( Mario Tuane ) and two from Argentina ( Jorge Kistenmacher  and  César Luis Menotti ).

Hugo Bagnulo  and  Gregorio Pérez  have coached Peñarol the longest, leading the first team for eight seasons: Bagnulo for four stints and Pérez for five.  Athuel Velásquez  had the longest uninterrupted coaching period for Peñarol (five straight years, between 1935 and 1940). Bagnulo has the most Uruguayan championships (five); Pérez and Velásquez follow, with four each. In international competition  Roberto Scarone  was the most successful manager, winning two Copa Libertadores and an Intercontinental Cup with Peñarol. [83] [84]

Caretaker managers  in  italics

During a meeting presided over by Roland Moor on 28 September 1913, it was stipulated that responsibility for the Central Uruguay Railway Cricket Club would belong to the principal administrator of the Central Uruguay Railway Company of Montevideo. The first president of the club was Frank Henderson, who remained in that office until 1899. [10]

After Henderson CUR administrators remained as chairmen of the sports club until 1906, when Charles W. Bayne took over the CUR. Bayne refused to sponsor the CURCC because of vandalism by fans and absenteeism by workers. He was replaced by CUR employee Roland Moor. [15]

Conflicts remained between the company and the sports club, which resulted in the separation of CURCC's football section from the company and a name change to Club Atlético Peñarol. [15]  Jorge Clulow, an Englishman with Uruguayan nationality, was chosen chairman of the club; he remained in office from 1914 to 1915. [83] [85]

Honorary

The most recent elections took place in November 2011. Juan Pedro Damiani remained as president of the club, with 58 percent of the votes. Aside from the president, ten other board members were elected. While the list "10" obtained seven board positions, the "2809" took three, and the "2011" one. [86] [87]

Peñarol played 26 seasons of the Uruguay Association Football League, from its creation in 1900 until the end of the amateur era in 1931 (absent 1923–26, when the club was disaffiliated from the AUF). [91]  During this period Peñarol won the  Uruguayan Championship  nine times, with its best years in  1900  and  1905 [92]  (when the club won the championship without conceding any points). Peñarol was undefeated in  1901 , [93]   1903 [94]  and  1907 . [note 10] [95]  Its worst year was 1908; the team left the league after ten games, forfeiting the other eight. [96]  Peñarol's largest goal difference in a game during its amateur era was in 1903, when they defeated Triunfo 12–0. [97]

The club placed second in  1923  (when they scored a record 100 goals), and won in  1924 ; its most impressive victory was a 10–0 win over Roberto Cherry during the cancelled 1925 season. [97]

Since the beginning of the professional era in  1932 , Peñarol and  Nacional  are the only teams who have played every season for the Uruguayan championship. [note 11] [98]  Peñarol has the most Uruguayan League titles (winning 38 times between  1932  and  2013 ) and the greatest number of undefeated championships ( 1949 ,  1954 ,  1964 ,  1967 ,  1968 ,  1975  and  1978 ). [99]  Its best performances were in  1949  and  1964 , seasons when the team scored 94.44 percent of possible points; its worst season was  2005–06 , when it finished in 16th place after winning 32.32 percent of possible points. [100]  A 12-point deduction given the team by the AUF because of unrest after a game with  Cerro  relegated them to that position. [101]

Peñarol's best victory was a 9–0 win against  Rampla Juniors  in 1962; its worst defeat was 0–6 against Nacional. On the international scene, its best result was an 11–2 win over  Valencia  of  Venezuela  on 15 March 1970; its worst was against  Olimpia  of  Paraguay , a 0–6 loss on 10 December 1990 during the  Supercopa Sudamericana .

Peñarol holds a number of national and international records. The club has the longest undefeated run in the Uruguayan league: 56 games, from 3 September 1966 to 14 September 1968. [36]  This is also the longest undefeated run in South American professional football (second place if amateur leagues are counted). [102]

It was the first club to win the  Copa Libertadores de América  undefeated, in  1960 . [103]  Peñarol has the greatest number of appearances in the Copa Libertadores (40), [104]  and the most appearances in the finals (10). [104]  The club holds the record for the biggest win (11–2 against Valencia), [103]  and the biggest goal difference in a two-legged elimination (defeating  Everest  from  Ecuador  5–0 and 9–1). [103]  Peñarol is one of the teams with five Intercontinental Cup appearances, the first to reach that number.

In 2009, the  International Federation of Football History & Statistics , not FIFA, released a list of the best clubs of the 20th century on each continent. The organization awarded points for each victory in a quarterfinal or higher in international competition but only took into account games played after 1932 for the Professional era. Peñarol was the number-one team in South America, above  Independiente  of Argentina and Nacional of Uruguay.

Peñarol's basketball records date back to the late 1920s, when Club Piratas was formed; in 1931, it became Peñarol. [4]  Its first league game (in the fourth division of Uruguayan basketball) was played in 1940. By 1943 the team, playing in the first division for Ramón Esnal, finished third. The following year Peñarol won the  Federal Championship , a tournament attracting the best basketball teams in Montevideo; in 2003, the league changed its name to  Liga Uruguaya de Basketball .

In 1945, Peñarol jumped from the  Uruguayan Basketball Federation  to play in a new league; [4]  when the upstart league failed, the club rejoined the federation in 1947. In 1952 Peñarol again won the Federal Championship, winning the Winter Tournament in 1953 and 1955. [110]  After a low period (with relegation in 1968), Peñarol won the Uruguayan Championship in 1973, 1978, and 1979;the latter was the first professional tournament in league history. [4]  In 1982 the club enjoyed its most successful season, winning the Federal Championship and [4]  the Winter Tournament [110]  The club also won the  Campeonato Sudamericano de Clubes  in 1983. In 1985 the club was relegated, beginning a downward spiral which ended with its expulsion from the league in 1997. [4]

Peñarol has participated in the  Vuelta Ciclista del Uruguay  (Tour of Uruguay) since it began in 1939. Although the team rode well during its early years, it was not until the ninth edition (in 1952) that a Peñarol cyclist would win the race (Dante Sudatti, with an overall time of 48 hours, 38 minutes and 38 seconds). Peñarol cyclists also won the general classification 1953 and 1956; in the latter year, the club won the team championship.

After again winning the team championship in 1959, Peñarol would only win one individual championship in 1964.
