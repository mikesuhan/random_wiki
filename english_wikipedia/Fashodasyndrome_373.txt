Fashoda syndrome , or a ' Fashoda complex' , [1]  is the name given to a tendency within French foreign policy in  Africa , giving importance to asserting French influence in areas which might be becoming susceptible to British influence. It is named for the  Fashoda incident  (1898) which is judged to have given rise to it. In  The State of Africa , the  British  historian  Martin Meredith  says:

Meredith judges that the 1990 French intervention in  Rwanda  was an expression of the "syndrome". Rwanda lies on the border between " Francophone " and " Anglophone " Africa. In 1990, there was a short-lived invasion by the  Rwandan Patriotic Front  (RPF), a coalition of  Tutsi  exiles and those advocating democratic reform. Many of the RPF had grown up in Tutsi refugee camps in formerly British-controlled  Uganda  and had learned to fight in the  Ugandan  army, and Uganda was seen by Paris as being, at that time, within the British sphere of influence.

The Fashoda complex has been used in connection with foreign policies of other countries, particularly  Egypt  and  Sudan . [1]
