John Leckie Ake  (August 29, 1861 – May 11, 1887) was an  American   Major League Baseball  player who played as a  third baseman  for the 1884  Baltimore Orioles  of the  American Association  (AA). Before and after his Major league career, he played for many professional  minor league baseball  teams from 1881 until his death in 1887. Described as a good and popular player, he died when the boat he was travelling in capsized in the  Mississippi River , and not knowing how to swim, he drowned.

Ake was born in  Altoona, Pennsylvania  on August 29, 1861 to William, a farmer, and his wife Anne. [1] [2] [3]  His family stayed in Altoona throughout his childhood, and Ake became a laborer later in his teen years. [4]

He began his professional baseball career in 1882 when he joined a club located in Altoona, having played for a local non-professional team the year before. He played for this professional club through the 1883 season, [5]  before signing a contract with the Baltimore Orioles of the American Association. [1]

He made his debut with the Orioles on May 12, 1884, and made his final appearance on June 15. During his time with Baltimore, he played in 13 games, playing mostly as their  third baseman , but played three games in the  outfield , and one game at  shortstop . He had a .192  batting average  in 52  at bats , collected ten  hits , one  triple , and scored one  run . [1]  After leaving the Orioles, he finished the year playing for a team in Fort Smith, Ohio. [5]  The following season, he played for a team in  Youngstown, Ohio , followed by a team  Meriden, Connecticut  for the 1886 season. Later in 1886, he transferred to the Boston Blues when they bought out the Meriden team. After the season, he signed with a  St. Louis, Missouri  team, which was later moved to  Indianapolis . He secured his release from the club shortly thereafter so he could sign with the  Duluth, Minnesota  club. [5]

On May 11, 1887, he and two of his Duluth teammates,  Bill Barnes  and  Billy Earle , were paddling in a  rowboat  on the  Mississippi River  near  La Crosse, Wisconsin , and Barron's Island. [6] [7]  It was just after 8 pm, and the trio were approximately 200 yards from the shore, when a passing  steamer  overturned their boat with its wake, leaving the three clinging to the boat for some time. [7] [8]  Barnes and Earle quickly swam to shore, but Ake, who did not know how to swim, hoisted himself on the overturned boat. [6]  Ake decided to attempt to swim ashore before Barnes and Earle could secure a rescue  skiff , [7]  but after a couple strokes, he began to shout for help, slipping under the water, and drowned. [6]  Barnes later recalled the way Earle looked at Ake during the incident. Earle, sometimes described as a "wierdo", as "creepy", and as having an " evil eye ", had an expression that Barnes never forgot. [6]

A thorough search for his body was conducted into the evening, but it was called off. It was thought that since the water was high, the chances of recovering his remains were slim, and it was best to wait until they surfaced later. [9]  His widowed mother asked that if his body was recovered, that his remains be delivered to Altoona. [9]  On June 4, 1887, fishermen discovered his body when their hooks snagged onto his clothes. Due to the condition of his remains, it was reported that he was immediately buried. [10]
