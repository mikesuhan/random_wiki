The Sensory Ethnography Lab  (SEL) at  Harvard University  is an interdisciplinary center for the making of anthropologically informed works of media that combine aesthetics and  ethnography . Production courses associated with the SEL are offered through Anthropology, Visual and Environmental Studies, and the  Graduate School of Design . [1]

Established as a collaboration between Harvardâ€™s departments of Anthropology and of Visual and Environmental Studies in 2006, the SEL provides technical facilities and support for Harvard's PhD in Media Anthropology, [2]  set up in 2007 as part of the graduate program in Social Anthropology. It has been praised as an "innovative initiative" [3]  at Harvard to integrate art-making within the cognitive life of the university, and was proposed as a model for future endeavors in the graduate curriculum by the Presidential Task Force on the Arts' Report in 2008. [4]  The SEL is managed by musician, anthropologist, and phonographer Ernst Karel, and directed by  Lucien Castaing-Taylor , ethnographic filmmaker of  In and Out of Africa  and  Sweetgrass . [5]  In the year-long core class, "Sensory Ethnography," students receive instruction in ethnographic media practices, and create a substantial work in video, still photography, hypermedia, or sound. Advanced graduate students are also provided with training and equipment to produce media ethnographies in conjunction with their written doctoral dissertations. [6]  One example includes students working alongside Ernst Karel and visual artist Sharon Lockhart to produce "Sound Safari", a collaborative phonography project, in Bath, Maine. [7]
