La Marque Independent School District  ( LMISD ) was a public  school district  based in  La Marque ,  Texas , in the  Houston metropolitan area . In addition to much of La Marque, the district served portions of  Texas City  and  Tiki Island . [1]  As of July 1, 2016 it consolidated into the  Texas City Independent School District .

In 2009, the school district was rated " academically acceptable " by the  Texas Education Agency . [2]

The Texas Education Agency's college readiness performance data shows that only 3.1% (5 out of 152 students) of the graduates of the class of 2010 of the La Marque school district met TEA's average performance criterion on SAT or ACT college admission tests. [3]

In 2010, after some state budget cuts occurred, the district considered closing Inter-City Elementary School. [4]

In 2011, the district was labeled academically unacceptable. [ citation needed ]

In March 2012 the district projected that it would have a $4.6 million deficit the following year. It considered closing Highlands Elementary School and Simms Elementary School to save $450,000. [5]

In 2015 the district had 2,500 students. [6]  On February 6, 2015, the  Texas Education Agency  revoked the District's accreditation, citing unacceptable academic ratings, as well as its poor financial situation. [7]  In April of that year the decision was put on hold. [8]  On September 23, 2015, the Texas Education Commissioner announced that the superintendent and school board would be removed and replaced by a state-appointed board of managers, but that the schools would remain open. The board of managers must either dissolve the district or return it to local control within two years. [9]

On November 12, 2015, La Marque ISD received a letter from TEA Commissioner Michael Williams advising the School Board that the district would be closed on July 1, 2016 and absorbed by another district. While it has not yet been announced who would be absorbing the district, Texas City ISD is the most likely candidate due to geographical location and is said to have a tentative plan in place to absorb the failed district, which includes keeping the campuses of LMISD open but under new administration. [10]  A conservator has been assigned by the TEA Commissioner to oversee the district and advise the school board for the remainder of the 15-16 school year. [11] [12]

On November 30, 2015, in a special meeting, the LMISD Board of trustees voted to hire a Houston Law firm at a cost of at least $300,000.00 to fight the decision by the TEA to close the district. [13]

On December 2, 2015, TEA Commissioner Williams announced that  Texas City ISD  would absorb LMISD effective July 1, 2016; [14]  LMISD successfully met its academic standards but failed to meet its financial ones. [15]

LMISD and TCISD students will continue to attend their respective neighborhood schools for the 2016-2017 school year. [16]  LMISD schools will remain open since there is not enough space at existing TCISD schools, and out of consideration of stability of the education of LMISD students. The athletic programs will not yet be consolidated. All LMISD staff will need to reapply for the 2016-2017 school year. [17]

Students from PreKindergarten to the 8th grade in the district required  school uniforms  or "standardized dress". [18]  The school required PreK-8 students to wear  golf shirts  colored navy, gold, or white and navy trousers. The  Texas Education Agency  specifies that the parents and/or guardians of students zoned to a school with uniforms may apply for a waiver to opt out of the uniform policy so their children do not have to wear the uniform; [19]  parents must specify " bona fide " reasons, such as religious reasons or philosophical objections.

High school students were permitted to wear solid-colored or striped golf shirts that do not have the colors red and black. Trousers were permitted to be navy, khaki, or denim. [18]
