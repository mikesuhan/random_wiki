Chillington Hall  is a  Georgian   country house  near  Brewood ,  Staffordshire ,  England , four miles northwest of  Wolverhampton . It is the residence of the Giffard family. The  Grade I listed  house was designed by  Francis Smith  in 1724 and  John Soane  in 1785. The park and lake were landscaped by  Capability Brown .

In the  Domesday Book , Chillington (Cillintone) is entered under  Warwickshire  as forming part of the estates of William FitzCorbucion. His grandson Peter Corbesun of Studley granted Chillington to Peter Giffard, his wife's nephew, for a sum of 25 marks and a charger of metal.

The present house is the third on the site. In the 12th century there was a stone castle on the site, a small corner of which can be seen in the cellars of the present house, and beside it the original house. This house was replaced in the 16th century by Sir John Giffard, who was  High Sheriff of Staffordshire  on five occasions. Peter Giffard began the third building by demolishing and replacing part of Sir John's Tudor house in 1724. This rebuilding replaced the existing south front of three storeys in red facing bricks with stone dressing.

In about 1725, Peter Giffard planted the long avenue of oak trees which formed the original approach to the house, but he probably incorporated many existing trees. During the 1770s,  Capability Brown  designed the landscape park and lake to the south of the house for Thomas Giffard the elder.

There are a number of Grade II and Grade II* listed structures on the estate. The Grade II* listed  dovecote  and stable block are on the  Buildings at Risk Register .
