Cooper Landing  is a  census-designated place  (CDP) in  Kenai Peninsula Borough ,  Alaska ,  United States , about 100 miles (160 km) south of  Anchorage , at the confluence of  Kenai Lake  and  Kenai River . The town was first settled in the 19th century by gold and mineral prospectors, and has become a popular Summer tourist destination thanks to its scenic wilderness location and proximity to the world-class salmon fishery of the Kenai River and Russian River. As of the  2010 census , the population in Cooper Landing was 289.

Cooper Landing was named for Joseph Cooper, a miner who discovered gold there in 1884. However, Peter Doroshin, a Russian engineer, had identified gold prospects as far back as 1848 when the territory was still part of  Russian America .

Cooper Creek was first recorded in 1898 by the  U.S. Geological Survey . In 1900, the Census found 21 miners and 1 wife living at Cooper Creek. The Riddiford  Post Office  began operations in 1924, and the Riddiford School opened in 1928.

In 1946, Pat and Helen Gwin arrived in Cooper Landing which had about 100 residents then. The Gwins eked out a living by operating a small packaged goods store out of a tent. That same year, construction began on the highway from Cooper Landing to  Homer . The  Sterling Highway , the road that is the artery of the  Kenai Peninsula , opened in 1950 and subsequently the  Seward Highway  opened in 1951. Gwin's Lodge was built from spruce logs harvested from the surrounding Chugach National Forest. Cutting, hauling and hand-peeling the logs, Pat and Helen Gwin completed and opened the lodge on January 1, 1952. Pat and Helen parted ways in 1959, but Helen stayed to run the lodge and retired in 1976. The historic Gwin's Lodge is one of the oldest log roadhouses in Alaska and is still in operation today.
