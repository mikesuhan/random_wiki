Crime  is present in various forms in  Cambodia .

In 2012, Cambodia had a murder rate of 6.5 per 100,000 population. [1]  There were a total of 964 murders in Cambodia in 2012. [1]

Petty crime is common, with tourist areas often targeted. This includes  snatch theft  and pick-pocketing. Perpetrators are usually stricken with poverty, and as a result are driven to steal from foreigners with the knowledge that they bring about a significant amount of money and other valuable items. Owing to the easy accessibility to arms, armed robbery also occurs. [2]

The rate of corruption in Cambodia is high; one source goes on to describe the situation as "nothing less than obscene". Corruption is considered a large expense to the Cambodian government. [3]  The Cambodian police force is known to inappropriately use violence in certain cases. [4]  The misuse of ferocity has raised concerns from the Human Rights Watch. [5]

Prostitution  is against the law  in Cambodia , but still present and only growing. Le Thi Quy, a professor from the Women's Research Center, interviewed a handful of females in 1993 about prostitution; three quarters of the interviewees found being a prostitute to be a  norm  and a profession they felt was not shameful having. [6]  That same year, the professor estimated that there were some one hundred thousand sex workers in the country. [6]
