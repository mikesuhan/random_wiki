Lynedoch  is a hamlet in  Norfolk County ,  Ontario ,  Canada  which was named after  Baron Lynedoch  who served under  Lord Wellington  during the  War of 1812 .

Lynedoch's earliest known inhabitants, from around the year 1000 until approximately 300–350 years later, were the  Algonquin  nation. They were noted flint-workers and evidence of the skill in crafting arrowheads is still to be found in open worked field areas surrounding the village. The next wave of inhabitants were the  Attawandaron  nation, the Neutrals, who occupied the region from about 1350 until their absorption by the  Iroquois  300 years later. The last significant native nation to occupy the area was the  Mississaugas .

During the 19th century, this hamlet had a post office, a school, tailor’s and blacksmith shops, taverns, hotels, and churches. [1]  A quaint church has been restored in the area and is being used for outdoor weddings in addition to garden parties and wedding receptions. [2]

In 2001, Haldimand-Norfolk was dissolved into two separate single-tier counties. Lynedoch became part of the newly formed County of Norfolk.

Agriculture  is the sole industry in the community and there is virtually no commerce. Residents can purchase  Dennis' Horseradish  from the Jason Ryder family farm just five minutes' driving distance to the east; they are a third-generation agriculture family in the area. [3] [4]

The village consists of elderly people on old age pensions in addition to a marginal amount of young married couples who wish to become homeowners. There is also a community group which is  non-profit  and consists mostly of people who live in the Lynedoch area. It is located northwest of  Pine Grove , southwest of  Delhi , and west of  Simcoe .

The warmest summers that Lynedoch has witnessed occurred in 1998, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009 (with the exception of the month of July [5] ), 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016. [6]

Should the sea levels rise by 60 metres or 200 feet, Lynedoch would not be affected by flooding. [7]  However, it may be affected by droughts as a by-product of the dislocation of available fresh water and may be forced to rely on  desalinated  salt water piped in from the  Eastern United States . Constructing the proper infrastructure to carry the water hundreds of miles away would take considerable manpower along with significant economic costs and an unprecedented level of cooperation from multiple federal, state/provincial, and municipal governments.
