The  Colleen  is a  one-design  wooden sailing  keelboat  originally designed for  sailing  in  Dublin  Bay, Ireland.

The class was intended to fit into the Dublin Bay Sailing Club's grouping of classes, as Class 'B'. This was a replacement of the half and one raters. It was felt that a One-Design would ensure that boats did not become outdated within a short number of years.

It was designed for the Dublin Bay Sailing Club in 1896 by James E. Doyle, one of Kingstown's leading yacht designers and builders. [1]

The Colleen is a half decked gaff rigged centreboard day boat with the centreboard case fixed externally under the boat.

The class stopped sailing in Dublin Bay in the early 1900s. After class racing finished in Dublin Bay many of the boats were shipped out to  Argentina  where the class thrived into the 1960s. Many of the Argentinian boats were renamed with stone names.

Yachting historian Hal Sisk built the replica "Colleen Bawn" in 2003 - in  glass-reinforced plastic .
