The  Inland Empire  metropolitan area and region of  Southern California , which sits directly east of the  Los Angeles metropolitan area , covers more than 27,000 square miles (70,000Â km 2 ). The metropolitan area consists of  Riverside County  and  San Bernardino County  and is home to over 4 million people. The Inland Empire contains many  museums , which defined for this context as institutions (including  nonprofit organizations , government entities, and private  businesses ) that collect and care for objects of cultural, artistic, scientific, or historical interest and make their collections or related exhibits available for public viewing. It also has non-profit and university art galleries. Museums that exist only in cyberspace (i.e.,  virtual museums ) are not included in this list.
