USS  Roark  (FF-1053) , originally designated  DE-1053 , was a  Knox -class   frigate  named for  William Marshall Roark ,  Distinguished Flying Cross  recipient and first American killed in the Vietnam War to have a ship named for them. [1]   Roark  was laid down on 2 February 1966 by the  Todd Shipyards Corporation  in  Seattle, Washington ; launched on 24 April 1967, sponsored by Mrs. William M. Roark, widow and Mrs. Frank F. Roark, mother of namesake; and commissioned on 22 November 1969, with  Commander  Wayne L. Beech in command.

Since completing shakedown in the spring of 1970,  Roark  a unit of DesRon 21, conducted training operations out of her homeport of  San Diego, California , until the end of the year. With 1971 she began preparations for her first deployment with the  7th Fleet  in the  Western Pacific  and departed from San Diego 7 January. After stopping at  Pearl Harbor  and refueling at  Midway Island ,  Roark  suffered a fire in her engine room. The damage was sufficient to require her return to Pearl Harbor for repairs. Almost two months later, in March, she was underway again for WestPac. She remained in the western Pacific until July, when she started for home, arriving in  San Diego, California , on 10 August. For the remainder of 1971,  Roark  operated out of San Diego.

The new year, 1972, brought with it another deployment to the  Far East . She departed San Diego on 8 February and arrived in  Subic Bay , Philippines, on 29 February. She operated in the Western Pacific, primarily in the Vietnam area until 15 August, when she pointed her bow homeward.  Roark  entered San Diego 30 August and remained in the vicinity for the duration of 1972 and the first eight months of 1973. She departed San Diego in August and arrived in Subic Bay on 31 August. After almost four months of deployment with the 7th Fleet,  Roark  sailed into San Diego on 21 December 1973.

Roark  transferred to the Naval Reserve in 1987 and was decommissioned 14 December 1991. She was disposed of by scrapping, dismantling beginning on 13 October 2004.

Roark  received three  campaign stars  for  Vietnam War  service.
