Circling Raven Golf Club  is an 18-hole championship  golf course  in the  northwest   United States , located in  northern   Idaho  near  Worley . It was rated the third best public course in Idaho by  Golf Digest  in August 2015. [3]

Owned and operated by the  Coeur d'Alene Tribe , Circling Raven opened for play fourteen years ago in the summer of 2003. [4] [5] [6] [7]  It was preceded on the site by a casino (1993) and hotel (2001). [8]  The course is named after a visionary chief of the tribe in the  18th century . [9] [10] [11]

Designed by  Florida -based architect Gene Bates, [5] [11]  the back tees at Circling Raven are at 7,189 yards (6,574 m); [1]  the  course rating  is 74.0 with a  slope rating  of 144. [2]  The terrain varies between rolling prairie, woodlands, and wetlands at an average  elevation  of approximately 2,600 feet (790 m) above  sea level . The course is spread out over more than 600 acres (2.4 km 2 ) and the practice facility covers 25 acres (10 ha). [11]

In September 2005, Circling Raven hosted a team from  Royal Dornoch Golf Club  in  Scotland  for a friendly international competition and cultural exchange. [12] [13]  The following August, the course was the site of the  Pacific Northwest PGA Professional Championship , won by Ryan Malby.
