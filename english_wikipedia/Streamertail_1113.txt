The  streamertails  are  hummingbirds  in the  genus   Trochilus  that is  endemic  to  Jamaica . It is the  type genus  of the  Trochilidae   family . Today most authorities consider the two  taxa  in this genus as separate species, but some (e.g.  AOU ) continue to treat them as  conspecific , in which case  scitulus  is a  subspecies  of  T. polytmus . A wide range of  common names  apply to this combined species, including  green-and-black streamertail ,  Jamaican streamertail  or simply  streamertail . The name  streamertail  is a reference to the greatly elongated  rectrices  of the males.
