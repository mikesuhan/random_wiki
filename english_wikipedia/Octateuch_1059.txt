The  Octateuch   / ˈ ɒ k . t ə . t juː k /  is a traditional name for the first eight books of the  Bible , comprising the  Pentateuch , plus the  Book of Joshua , the  Book of Judges  and the  Book of Ruth . [1]  These texts make up the first eight books of the Bible in a traditional Christian ordering. This order is quite different from that of the  Tanakh  where Ruth is considered as part of the third section of the canon (the "Ketubim" or "Writings") and is found after the Song of Solomon, being the second of the  Five Megillot .
