Thomas Robert Shannon Broughton ,  FBA  (17 February 1900 – 17 September 1993) was a  Canadian   classical  scholar and leading  Latin   prosopographer  of the twentieth century. [1]  He is especially noted for his definitive three-volume work,  Magistrates of the Roman Republic  (1951-1986). [2]

Broughton was born in 1900 in  Corbetton, Ontario . He attended  Victoria College  at the  University of Toronto . There he received a  B.A.  in 1921 with honors in classics. He earned his M.A. in 1922. After studying at the  University of Chicago , he was made a Rogers Fellow at  Johns Hopkins University , where he received a  Ph.D.  in Latin in 1928, having studied under the famed ancient historian  Tenney Frank  (1876-1939).

He began his teaching career at  Victoria College, Toronto . Broughton would go on to teach at  Amherst College ,  Bryn Mawr College  (1928-1965) and, later, serve as  George L. Paddison  Professor of Latin at the  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  (1965-1971), where the  Library Epigraphy Room , created at his behest, remains a seminal resource. Although he retired from UNC in 1971 (then aged 71), he would continue to work and advise students until his death in 1993. [1]

In 1931, he married  Annie Leigh Hobson Broughton  of  Norfolk, Virginia . They had two children, Margaret Broughton Tenney and  T. Alan Broughton  (b. 1936), a poet and pianist and professor  emeritus  of the  University of Vermont . Mrs. Broughton died on September 19, 2005, in  Charleston, South Carolina . [3]

Broughton's main scholarly work was his massive, three-volume  Magistrates of the Roman Republic  (commonly abbreviated  MRR ), published 1951 to 1986 and requiring more than 30 years to complete. The project provides an unparalleled accounting of the names of men elected to office during the  Roman Republic  and has become a standard reference work. It provides a year-by-year list of all known office-holders, including not only the magistracies of the  cursus honorum  from  consul  to  quaestor , but also promagistracies and military commands in the  provinces ,  legates  (both official and ad hoc), military prefects, priesthoods, and special commissions. Each entry is documented with ancient sources and selected works of modern scholarship. An index by name, listing each man's known offices, appears in volume 2.

In 1953 the  Magistrates of the Roman Republic  was recognized with the  Goodwin Award of Merit  from the  American Philological Association . [4]

Broughton’s career included a variety of academic appointments and awards: visiting professor at Johns Hopkins University, Simon F. Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellow, holder of a Fulbright research grant to Italy and professor in charge of the School of Classical Studies of the  American Academy in Rome .

Broughton served as  president of the American Philological Association  and as vice president of the  International Federation of Societies of Classical Studies  for 10 years. He was a member of the  American Philosophical Society , a fellow of the  American Academy of Arts and Sciences , an honorary member of the  Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies , a corresponding member of the  German Archaeological Institute  and a corresponding Fellow of the  British Academy . Three universities awarded him honorary LL.D. degrees: Johns Hopkins University in 1969, the University of Toronto in 1971 and UNC in 1974.
