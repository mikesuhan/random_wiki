Xavier Vives  (born January 23, 1955) is a Spanish  economist  regarded as one of the main figures in the field of  industrial organization  and, more broadly,  microeconomics . [2]  He is currently chaired Professor and academic director of the  Public-Private Sector Research Center [3]  at  IESE Business School  in  Barcelona . [4] [5]

A native of Barcelona, after obtaining his bachelor's degree from the  Autonomous University of Barcelona  (UAB), received a doctorate from  UC Berkeley  under the supervision of  Gérard Debreu , and moved to the  University of Pennsylvania  as an Assistant Professor. In 1987 moved back to Spain and headed for ten years the Institute for Economic Analysis (CSIC) in the decade of the 1990s. In 2001 he moved to the business school INSEAD in  Paris  and in 2005 went back to Barcelona with a research professorship at ICREA-UPF ( Pompeu Fabra University ). He has taught also at UAB and held visiting positions at Harvard University, the University of California at Berkeley and New York University. He served as Director of the Industrial Organization Program of the Center for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) in 1991-1997. [6]  He has been editor of the  International Journal of Industrial Organization  in 1993-1997, editor-in-chief of the  European Economic Review  (1998–2002) and of the  Journal of the European Economic Association  (2003–2008). [7]  Currently he is editor of the  Journal of Economic Theory [8]  and co-editor of the  Journal of Economics & Management Strategy . [9]  He has participated extensively in the policy debate in Europe with contributions to a substantial number of reports published by CEPR and  CESifo   [10]  networks as well as columns in  The Financial Times ,  The Wall Street Journal  and the Spanish press.

Vives' research concentrates on microeconomics and ranges from industrial organization, information economics, and game theory to banking and finance. His contributions started with seminal research in  oligopoly theory  and the study of price and quantity competition providing canonical models and results on price formation and competitiveness. [11] [12] [13]  The research extended to the interaction between private information and strategic behavior with the early study of information sharing among firms. [14] [15]  This research has served as a basis for extensive theoretical and applied developments in industrial organization and international trade among other fields, as well as having implications for competition policy. A path breaking contribution was the pioneer application of lattice-theoretic methods to analyze games of strategic complementarities (or supermodular games), and in general complementarities, in economics. [16] [17] [18] [19]  His contribution opened the gates to numerous applications in a wide range of fields including macroeconomics and finance. Further work has studied incomplete information economies and the mechanisms of information aggregation and transmission in markets and learning by traders formalizing the ideas of Hayek. This work provides a bridge between the rational expectations and the herding literatures. [20] [21] [22]  Finally, Vives has contributed to the study of competition and regulation in banking and of financial stability with research that has policy implications for the financial crisis and European financial integration.

He has received several research prizes in Spain, among them the Premio Rey Jaime I de Economía in 2013. [31]  In 2008 he was awarded a European Research Council Advanced Grant. [32]
