Bjåen  or  Bjåi  is a small village in  Bykle  municipality in  Aust-Agder  county,  Norway . The village is located along the  Norwegian National Road 9  (the road may be closed in winter, due to heavy snow and bad weather). The village sits on the north shore of the lake Breidvatn, about 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) north of the village of  Hovden  and about 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) south of  Haukeli  in neighboring  Vinje  municipality. The area is primarily agricultural, specializing in  sheep herding  rather than growing crops, but Bjåen is probably best known for the Bjåen tourist lodge in the high mountain area. [2]
