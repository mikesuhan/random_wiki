Muttalib ibn Abdallah ibn Malik al-Khuza'i  was a son of the  Abbasid  general and administrator  Abdallah ibn Malik al-Khuza'i . During the  civil war  between  al-Amin  and  al-Ma'mun , he sided with the latter. In 811, he administered the oath of allegiance ( bay'ah ) to al-Ma'mun for  Mosul , and was named governor of  Egypt  briefly in 813 and again in 814â€“816. In 817, however, after al-Ma'mun chose the  Alid   Ali al-Rida  as his heir, Muttalib joined the uprising in  Baghdad  against al-Ma'mun, and even administered the oath to the city's rival Caliph,  Ibrahim ibn al-Mahdi .
