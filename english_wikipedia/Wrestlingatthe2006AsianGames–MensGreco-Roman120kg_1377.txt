The men's Greco-Roman 120Â kg wrestling competition at the  2006 Asian Games  in  Doha  was held on 10 December 2006 at the  Aspire Hall 4 .

This  Greco-Roman wrestling  competition consisted of a single-elimination tournament, with a  repechage  used to determine the winner of two bronze medals. The two finalists faced off for gold and silver medals. Each wrestler who lost to one of the two finalists moved into the repechage, culminating in a pair of bronze medal matches featuring the semifinal losers each facing the remaining repechage opponent from their half of the bracket.

Each bout consisted of up to three rounds, lasting two minutes apiece. The wrestler who scored more points in each round was the winner of that rounds; the bout finished when one wrestler had won two rounds (and thus the match).
