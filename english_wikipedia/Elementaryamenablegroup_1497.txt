In  mathematics , a  group  is called  elementary amenable  if it can be built up from  finite groups  and  abelian groups  by a sequence of simple operations that result in  amenable groups  when applied to amenable groups. Since finite groups and abelian groups are amenable, every elementary amenable group is amenable - however, the converse is not true.

Formally, the class of elementary amenable groups is the smallest subclass of the class of all groups that satisfies the following conditions:

The  Tits alternative  implies that any amenable linear group is locally virtually solvable; hence, for linear groups, amenability and elementary amenability coincide.
