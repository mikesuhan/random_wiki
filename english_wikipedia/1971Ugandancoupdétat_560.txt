The  1971 Ugandan coup d'état  was a military  coup d'état  executed by the  Ugandan  military, led by general  Idi Amin , against the government of President  Milton Obote  on January 25, 1971. The seizure of power took place while Obote was abroad attending the  Commonwealth   Heads of State conference  in  Singapore . [1]  Amin was afraid that Obote might dismiss him.

The 1971 coup is often cited as an example of "class action by the military", wherein the  Ugandan armed forces  acted against "an increasingly socialist régime whose equalitarian domestic politics posed more and more of a threat to the military's economic privileges". [2]

Amin was largely supported by the British before and after the coup because the previous President, Milton Obote, was attempting to nationalise UK businesses. [ citation needed ]
