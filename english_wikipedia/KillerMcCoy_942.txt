Killer McCoy  is a 1947 American film about a boxer. It is a remake of  The Crowd Roars  (1938).

Tommy McCoy is a tough New York City boy, close to his dad, Brian, a performer in  vaudeville . One night while his dad's doing a song and dance for the audience as part of a boxing event, Tommy accepts a challenge to step into the ring. He knocks out his opponent.

Lightweight champ Johnny Martin is impressed. He takes the McCoys on the road, letting Brian perform and showing Tommy the ropes of the boxing business. Tommy wins several fights and gains popularity, but kills a man in the ring and wants to quit. Then he discovers that his dad is heavily in debt to racketeer Jim Caighn and has gambled away Tommy's earnings.

Tommy begins a romantic relationship with the gangster's daughter, Sheila. He is expected to throw a big fight so that Caighn can collect a big payoff from his gambling rivals, and to ensure his dive in the eighth round, Sheila is taken hostage. But she manages to escape, inspiring Tommy to knock out his foe.

The film was a notable change of pace for Mickey Rooney, and it was a hit, earning $2,201,000 in the US and Canada and $990,000 elsewhere [1]  making a profit of $768,000. [2] [3]
