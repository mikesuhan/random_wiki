Hoplandrothrips [1]  (commonly misspelled as  Hoplandothrips [2] ) is a genus of  thrips  in the  Phlaeothripidae  family. Some species are recorded as pests on coffee growing in  East Africa , causing a distinctive rolling of the leaf. [2] [3]

Adults are dark brown and around 2Â mm long and the larvae are pale yellow. [4]  In coffee, they feed on young leaves causing them to roll very tightly, reducing the photosynthetic area of the leaf. They tend to cause little loss in yield however compared to  coffee berry borer  and  antestia bugs . [2]
