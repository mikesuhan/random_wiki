"Heilongjiangosaurus"  (meaning " Heilongjiang Province   lizard ") is the informal name given to an as-yet undescribed  genus  of  duckbilled   dinosaur  from the  Late Cretaceous . It possibly was a  lambeosaurine , and may in fact be the same animal as  Charonosaurus . The  fossils  were found in  Maastrichtian -age rocks in Heilongjiang,  China . As a  nomen nudum , we cannot be certain of what it is supposed to be, but there also appears to be a connection to an obscure species called  Mandschurosaurus jiayinensis , [1]  named in 1983. [2]

The "type species" is "H. jiayinensis", and it was coined in 2001 in a  faunal  list by Li and Jin. [3]
