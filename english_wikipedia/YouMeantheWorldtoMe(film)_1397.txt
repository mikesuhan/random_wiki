You Mean the World to Me  ( Chinese :  海墘新路 ;  Pe̍h-ōe-jī :  Hái-kîⁿ-sin-lō͘ ) is a 2017  Malaysian  semi- autobiographical  drama film directed and written by  Saw Teong Hin , based on a stage play that he made two years before in 2014.

The film, set in 1970s  Penang , [1]  is the first Malaysian film to be filmed entirely in  Penang Hokkien . [2]  The film's Chinese name, 海墘新路 (Hái-Kînn Sin-Lōo), refers to a Hokkien nickname for Victoria Street in  George Town ,  Penang .

The film's script was written based on Saw's family history and his estranged relationship with his mother. [3]  After the script was finished, Saw had desires of turning into a film but lacked enough money to do so. He presented the script to several parties who were interested in the project but they had conditioned that the film be made in  Mandarin  instead, to which Saw refused. [4]  Thus, he decided that the script be made into a  stage play  first. The play, under the name of  Hai Ki Xin Lor , was held in 2014 during the George Town Festival to receptive audiences.

The film's  theme song , "感謝妳 (Kám-siā-lú)" was performed by Taiwanese singer  Chao Chuan . [6]
