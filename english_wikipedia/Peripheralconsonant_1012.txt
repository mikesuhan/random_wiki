In  Australian linguistics , the  peripheral consonants  are a  natural class  encompassing consonants articulated at the extremes of the mouth:  labials  and  velars . That is, they are the non- coronal consonants . In  Australian languages , these consonants pattern together both  phonotactically  and  acoustically . In  Arabic  and  Maltese   philology , the  moon letters  transcribe non-coronal consonants, but they do not form a natural class.

Australian languages typically favour peripheral consonants word- and syllable-initially, and they are not allowed or common word- and syllable-finally, unlike the  apicals .

In the extinct  Martuthunira , the peripheral stops  /p/  and  /k/  shared similar  allophony . Whereas the other stops could be voiced between vowels or following a nasal, the peripherals were usually voiceless.
