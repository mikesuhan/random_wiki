Peter B. Moyle  (born 1942 in Minnesota) is  Distinguished Professor Emeritus  in the Department of Wildlife, Fish and Conservation Biology and associate director of the Center for Watershed Sciences at the  University of California-Davis . He has studied the  ecology  and  conservation  of fishes in  freshwater  and  estuarine   habitats  in California (US) for over forty years. He has taken a special interest in  salmon  and various other  anadromous fishes . Moyle has authored or co-authored more than 220 publications covering topics such as watersheds, inland fishes, biological invasions, and biodiversity in aquatic ecosystems. His primary areas of research include ecosystems, conservation of aquatic species, habitats, and various ecological impacts.

Moyle's primary areas of research include conservation efforts, development of novel aquatic ecosystems, the biology of freshwater and estuarine fishes native to California, and various effects on ecosystems such as that caused by invasions of alien aquatic species. His work has also focused on the effects of drought and climate change on California's rivers and streams, on the ecology and management of floodplains, and applying reconciliation ecology to the San Francisco Estuary.
