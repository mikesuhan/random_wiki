The  Bowman Lake Patrol Cabin  in  Glacier National Park , Montana, United States, is a  rustic  back-country log cabin. Built in 1934, the cabin has a single room, with a front porch extension to create a shelter from snowfall. [2]

During the 1920s and 1930s the  National Park Service  built a series of snowshoe cabins or patrol cabins in Glacier's back country. The cabins were built to a standardized plan that was developed in  Yellowstone National Park , which were themselves similar to those used by the  U.S. Forest Service  which took design cues from trappers' cabins. Cabins usually included a bear-and-rodent-proof food cache under the floor. Furnishings were limited to a hinged cupboard which could be folded down to form a table, a stove, and a bunk bed. [3]

The Bowman Lake cabin, located closer to the "front country" than most, featured a six-burner wood stove, a permanent table and a bedding storage box. [3]
