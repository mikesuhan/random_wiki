Alta Gracia Apparel  is a  living wage   apparel  company located in the  Dominican Republic . [1] [2] [3]  It is currently owned by Donnie Hodge, one of the original Founders who also serves as CEO.

The Alta Gracia factory opened in 2010 [4]  and pays its employees a  living wage , as established by the  Workers Rights Consortium , for adequate food and shelter, which is about three and a half times the average income of apparel workers in the Dominican Republic. This Living Wage, which is established Independently by the WRC (Worker's Rights Consortium) is set to provide a family of four the basic needs of housing, food, healthcare etc. The factory employs about 150 unionized people who in 2013 make about $3 per hour, or $500 per month. This compares to the average wage in Bangladesh of $40 to $64 per month, according to a May 2013 survey reported by  Reuters . [1] [4]

Alta Gracia is located in a former apparel  sweatshop , [3]  that made baseball caps for  Reebok  and  Nike  until 2007. Its owner, BJ+B moved its clothing manufacture operations to Vietnam and Bangladesh where there were lower employment costs.

Offering workers a fair wage came as the result of co-founders Donnie Hodge and Joe Bozich's response to student concerns regarding conditions under which collegiate apparel were produced. The  Workers Rights Consortium  along with student activist groups like the  United Students Against Sweatshops , and James Wilkerson, Director of Trademark Licensing and Stores Operations at  Duke University , were early leaders in the movement.

Alta Gracia makes sweatshirts and T-shirts with college logos [4]  which are mainly sold at about 400 college bookstores in the United States and at  Barnes and Nobles  bookstores. [1]  For instance, Alta Gracia's clothing is carried at the bookstores of  Duke University , as well as  Georgetown University [5]  the  University of Notre Dame ,  University of Missouri , [3]  and  Temple University . [6]  the  University of Minnesota , [2]

Its challenge is to successfully market their apparel that, with the increased wages, is now at the price point of  Nike  and  Adidas  clothing. An industry analyst, Andrew Jassin, stated in the  New York Times  article, "Factory Defies Sweatshop Label, but Can It Thrive?" that â€œThere are consumers who really care and will buy this apparel at a premium price, and then there are those who say they care, but then just want value." He noted that to be successful, the organization would need to skillfully market to buyers interested in "fair trade" practices. [1]

T-shirts made by Alta Gracia are tagged with messages that include an endorsement by the Workers Rights Consortium, pictures of workers, and a message from the workers "Your purchase will change our lives." [1]
