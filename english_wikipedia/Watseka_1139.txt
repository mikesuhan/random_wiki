Watseka  or  Watchekee  (c. 1810â€“1878) was a  Potawatomi  Native American woman, born in  Illinois , and named for the heroine of a Potawatomi legend. Her uncle was Tamin, the chief of the Kankakee  Potawatomi  Indians. [1]

In 1824, at age ten, she became engaged to  Gurdon Saltonstall Hubbard , whom she married at age fourteen or fifteen. Hubbard and Watseka had two children, both of whom died in infancy. [ citation needed ]  They mutually dissolved the union in 1826. [2]  Watseka married  Noel Le Vasseur  at age eighteen, and was described as "beautiful, intelligent and petite." [3]  She had three children with Le Vasseur, who learned to speak the  Potawatomi language . In 1836, she left for  Council Bluffs, Iowa , where her tribe had been removed in 1832 following the Treaty of Camp Tippecanoe. She died in Council Bluffs in 1878. [3]

A city  in East Central  Illinois  may have been named in her honor.
