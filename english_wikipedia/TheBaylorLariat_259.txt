The Baylor Lariat  is the student newspaper of  Baylor University  in  Waco, Texas . In 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014, the Houston Press Club named it the best student newspaper in the state of  Texas . [1] [2]

The Baylor Lariat  was officially begun in 1900 as  The Varsity Lariat ; it was formed out of a realization that "a high grade weekly was desired" to keep students, faculty, and alumni aware of campus events and news (including news from nearby colleges). The Lariat replaced  The Baylor Weekly Leaf , whose editor was credited in the Lariat's first issue with "taking the initiative" of reporting Baylor news. [3]

On February 27, 2004,  The Baylor Lariat  published an editorial in support of  San Francisco 's offering of marriage licenses to  gay  couples. The piece, which was supported by five of the editorial board's seven members, elicited a response from Robert B. Sloan Jr., who served as Baylor University president at the time. In a written statement, he claimed that he and many of the students, alumni, and parents were "justifiably outraged". [4] [5]  Among the board members in favor of the controversial piece was Dennis B. Ranford, who would later be fired [6]  from  The Guardian .
