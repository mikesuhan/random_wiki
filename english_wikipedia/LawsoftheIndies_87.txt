The  Laws of the Indies  ( Spanish :  Leyes de Indias ) are the  entire body of laws  issued by the  Spanish Crown  for the  American  and Philippine possessions of its  empire . They regulated social, political and economic life in these areas. The laws are composed of myriad decrees issued over the centuries and the important laws of the 16th century, which attempted to regulate the interactions between the settlers and natives, such as the  Laws of Burgos  (1512) and the  New Laws  (1542).

Throughout the 400 years of Spanish presence in these parts of the world, the laws were compiled several times, most notably in 1680 under  Charles II  in the  Recopilación de las Leyes de los Reynos de Indias  (Compilation of the Laws of the Kingdoms of the Indies). This became considered the classic collection of the laws, although later laws superseded parts of it, and other compilations were issued.

The  Spanish Viceroyalties in the Americas  sometimes generated conflicts between  indigenous peoples   ('Natives' or 'Indians') and the Spanish colonists. The Spanish attempted to control the Natives to force their labor. At the same time, conflicts on policy and implementation occurred between the  encomenderos  and the Crown.

Two of the main sets of laws issued in the 16th century regulated Spanish interaction with the  Native peoples , an issue about which the Crown quickly became concerned soon after the  voyages of Christopher Columbus  and his governorship. The  Laws of Burgos  (1512), signed by King  Ferdinand II of Aragon , focused upon the welfare of the conquered native peoples. The issue was revisited after  Bartolomé de las Casas  brought attention to abuses being carried out by  encomenderos . The Laws of Burgos were revised by the  New Laws of 1542  issued by  Carlos I  and quickly revised again in 1552, after the laws met resistance from colonists. These were followed by the  Ordinances Concerning Discoveries  in 1573, which forbade any unauthorized operations against independent Native Americans. [1]

The  Valladolid debate  (1550–1551) was the first moral debate in European history to discuss the rights and treatment of a  colonized people  by colonizers. Held in the  Colegio de San Gregorio , in the  Spanish  city of  Valladolid , it was a moral and theological debate about the  colonization of the Americas , its justification for the conversion to  Catholicism  and more specifically about the relations between the European settlers and the natives of the  New World . It consisted of a number of opposing views about the way natives were to be integrated into colonial life, their conversion to Christianity and their rights and obligations. According to the French historian Jean Dumont The  Valladolid debate  was a major turning point in world history  “In that moment in Spain appeared the dawn of the human rights” . [2]

To guide and regularize the establishment of  presidios  (military towns), missions, and  pueblos  (civilian towns), King Phillip II developed the first version of the  Laws of the Indies.  This comprehensive guide was composed of 148 ordinances to aid colonists in locating, building, and populating settlements. They codified the  city planning  process and represented some of the first attempts at a general plan. Signed in 1573, the  Laws of the Indies  are considered the first wide-ranging guidelines towards design and development of communities. These laws were heavily influenced by  Vitruvius '  Ten Books of Architecture  and  Leon Battista Alberti 's treatises on the subject.

In Book IV of the 1680 compilation of  The Laws of the Indies,  plans were set forth in detail on every facet of creating a community, including  town planning . Examples of the range of rules include:

These rules are part of a body of 148 regulations configuring any settlement according to the rule of Spain and its colonies. This continued as a precedent in all towns under Spanish control until the relinquishing of the land to others, as in the case of the American colonies and their growth. The Laws of the Indies are still used as an example to design guidelines for communities today [ citation needed ] .

The Laws specify many details of towns. A plan is made centered on a Plaza Mayor (main square) of size within specified limits, from which twelve straight streets are built in a rectilinear grid. The directions of the streets are chosen according to the prevailing winds, to protect the Plaza Mayor. The guidelines recommend a  hospital  for non-contagious cases near the church, and one for  contagious diseases  further away. [3]

Most townships founded in any part of the Spanish Empire in America before the various parts became independent countries were planned according to the Laws. These include many townships with Spanish names located in what is now the United States. The creation of a central square and rectilinear grid of streets was different from the haphazard and organic growth that led to meandering streets in many old townships in Iberia.
