After the  Second World War , Thiesies helped form the rugby department of  BSG Stahl Hennigsdorf , which he coached until 1977. He was also the coach of the  German Democratic Republic national rugby union team  from 1951 to 1972. [1]

Thiesies was born in 1908 in  Berlin , as the son of the custodian of a block of rental flats. After his school years, he took out an apprenticeship as a  tailor  and took up  boxing  and  gymnastics  as sports. [1]

He came in contact with the sport of rugby union through  Tennis Borussia Berlin  and the  Berliner SV 92 Rugby  and, despite his humble origins was ambitious in life. He broke through as a forward to the first team of the Berliner SV and the  German national team . He was described as a player of iron discipline by Hermann Meister, long term president of the  German Rugby Federation , and was somebody who abstained from alcohol and nicotine, rather devoting his time to running and cycling. He was called up fourteen times for Germany from 1934 to 1940. [1]  He was part of the German team that achieved Germanys last rugby victory over  France , a 3-0 on 27 March 1938 in  Frankfurt am Main . [2]

During the Second World War, he was stationed in  France  and was able to make contact with French rugby players, who he trained with. [1]

Having lost his house in Berlin through  aerial bombings  during the war, he and his wife Jette moved to relatives in  Hennigsdorf  after the war. He began to train the local youth in the game of rugby and was the founding father of the rugby department of BSG Stahl Hennigsdorf. [1] [3]

In 1950, he became a member of the new rugby branch of the  East German Football Association . He became the full-time coach of  Stahl  in 1953, being employed through the local steelworks. He was also the first coach of the new East German national team, which he was in charge of in 35 internationals throughout the years. [1]

Until his retirement in 1977, he coached  Stahl  to 17 national championships. Over the years, he was honoured by German and international rugby federations for his service to the sport. [1]

He remained a strong supporter of rugby in Hennigsdorf until his death in 1993 and is remembered as the soul of rugby in the town. [1]
