Sir David de Brechin  (died 1320) was a  Scottish  knight who fought on both sides during the  Wars of Scottish Independence .

He was the son of Sir William de Brechin by Elena Comyn, daughter of  Alexander Comyn, Earl of Buchan  and Elizabeth de Quincy. Sir William was the son of Henry, an illegitimate son of  David of Scotland, Earl of Huntingdon . [1]  Brechin is first attested to as a ward of a Sir John de Callendar in 1292. [2]

Brechin fought in the  Earl of Surrey 's army at the  Battle of Dunbar , and was granted lands previously owned by  Alan Durward . [3]

He name appears twice on the 1296  Ragman Rolls  for  Forfarshire . [4]

In the train of  Robert the Bruce , he was present at Peebles when the Bruce,  John Comyn , and  William Lamberton  were sworn in as  Guardians of Scotland . Brechin returned to Galloway with Bruce. [5]

By 1301, Sir David was still active in south western Scotland. On 8 September Brechin was in a force led by  Sir John de Soulis  and  Sir Ingram de Umfraville , that attacked  Lochmaben Castle , and was wounded in the fight. [6]

Brechin returned to English service when he did homage to  Edward I of England  at the  Siege of Stirling Castle . [7]

Continuing in English service, Brechin was present at the  Battle of Inverurie , and according to  John Barbour , he retired after the battle to  Brechin Castle  where he was besieged by  David Earl of Atholl . [8]  However this is contested by the historian and genealogist Sir  James Balfour Paul . [9]

On 6 April 1320, Brechin appended his seal to the  Declaration of Arbroath .

At a parliament at  Scone  (later known as the  Black Parliament ) in August that year, Brechin was found complicit along with  William de Soules , the  Countess of Strathearn  and others in a conspiracy to depose the king. For this offence Brechin was executed. [10]

Although he may very well have been guilty, his execution surprised some people, as he was seen as a "flower of chivalry", having acquitted himself well in battle against the Saracens in the past.

Brechin appears to have married Margaret de Bonkyll, widow of  Sir John Stewart of Bonkyll , by 1304 when she is recorded as his wife. [11]  and had issue.

David de Brechin appears to have married secondly a Margaret Ramsay.
