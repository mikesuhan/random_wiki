Partner-assisted reproduction  (also known as  reception of oocyctes from partner  ( ROPA )) is a family model first introduced in  Spain  in 2009. [1]  In partner-assisted reproduction, one woman provides the eggs, and the embryo is implanted into her female partner's womb. (As a technical matter, this technique does not differ from  oocyte donation . [2] ) Using this process ensures that each partner is a  biological mother  of the child.
