Insignia Financial Group  was a  Delaware corporation , headquartered in  Greenville, South Carolina , engaged in the aggregation,  management , and  disposition  of multifamily  apartment complexes . Founded by Andrew L. Farkas with an initial capitalization of $5.5 million provided by an  investor   syndicate  organized by Farkas, Insignia consummated the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of U.S. Shelter Corporation, a multifamily  real estate  syndicator, on December 31, 1990. Insignia was taken public in 1991 by a syndicate led by  Lehman Brothers  and  Dillon, Read & Co.  Its stock was listed on the NYSE under the symbol IFG.

Insignia was among the first companies to use tender offers to increase its ownership of limited partnerships owning multifamily property. Insignia refinanced substantial portions of its multifamily portfolio in bulk through the first two non cross collateralized  real estate mortgage investment conduits , sponsored by Lehman Brothers, in 1992 and 1993.

Insignia sold its multifamily business to  Apartment Investment and Management Company  for $1.4 billion in 1999. The remainder of Insignia was sold for approximately $120 million to  C.B. Richard Ellis  in the Winter of 2003.
