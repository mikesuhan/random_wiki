Care UK  is a British company providing health and social care. The company works with councils,  primary care trusts  and doctors to deliver care and support for older people and those with  learning disabilities  or  mental health  problems, as well as a range of healthcare services for NHS patients.

The company was formed as Anglia Secure Homes in 1982, becoming Care UK PLC in 1994.

In 1997, the company acquired Care Solutions Limited, a learning disabilities provider responsible for 59 homes in Newcastle, Bradford, Staffordshire and Guildford. In 1998, it took on a further seven care homes in Hampshire and the South Coast with the acquisition of The Care Partnership.

Care UK delisted from the stock exchange in 2010 following a  management buyout . Since 2010 its major shareholder has been  Bridgepoint Capital . [1]

It bought  Harmoni  in 2012 from  ECI Partners  for about £50 million. [2]

In January 2014 it was announced that Philippa Slinger, the former chief executive of the troubled  Heatherwood and Wexham Park Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust  is to join Care UK. [3]

Since the  Health and Social Care Act 2012  came into force in April 2013 Care UK has won three contracts worth £104m. [4]

In 2014/5 its turnover was £728 million. [5]

Following the death of a vulnerable inmate at  HM Prison Chelmsford  in January 2017 and criticism by the Prison ombudsman, Care UK announced it would end its healthcare contract there as the level of resource the prison service made available was insufficient. [6]

Care UK operates 85  care home  facilities for older people as well as supporting over 17,000 older people and those with disabilities through  home care  services.

The company runs 4 clinical assessment and treatment centres (CATS) and 7 NHS  treatment centres , offering a range of procedures for conditions such as cataract surgery and hip replacements. In 2011, independent research organisation,  Dr Foster , named Care UK as the best performing provider for hip operations. [7]

Care UK also operates 12 GP-led  health centre  facilities providing walk-in services and a range of specialist mental health services including 18 homes and hospitals and residential treatment programmes for young people who have serious  eating disorders .

In 2013 a joint venture with  Sussex Partnership NHS Trust  was created to purchase a 32-bed mental health rehabilitation unit in  Gosport , and to create a 24-bed self-contained accommodation unit later in the year. [8]

The company strategy is to concentrate on the provision of primary and secondary NHS health services. [9]  In May 2015 the company sold its mental health assets, consisting of 322 beds, to  Partnerships in Care  and its learning disability services group to  Lifeways Group . In June 2015 the home care service which generated revenue of £72.2 million and looks after approximately 13,000 people across the UK and employs around 6,000 staff members was sold to  Mears Group . [10]

It is the largest firm providing  out-of-hours services  in England services with more than ten million patients.

John Nash , the chairman of Care UK, made a donation of £21,000 to the private office of  Andrew Lansley , who would later become  Secretary of State for Health , but was at the time the health spokesman for the opposition. Lansley has since been accused of a  conflict of interest , as Care UK would be a major beneficiary of the proposed changes. [11] [12]

In 2014, Care UK's former chairman Lord Nash became a government minister and Care UK took over services for people with severe learning disabilities in Doncaster, south Yorkshire - where they immediately cut wages of staff who had been on NHS terms by up to 35% while bringing in 100 new workers on £7 an hour. Fifty carers for the disabled began strike action in protest and by August 2014, had been on strike for 7 weeks - making it one of the longest strikes in the history of the NHS. Care UK won the supported living contract from the council after telling officials that it could deliver it for £6.7m over three years. Yet the wage bill alone for the service was £7m. [13]

A report in  The Guardian  of 17 March 2012 stated that Care UK "has a reduced tax bill by taking out loans through the Channel Islands stock exchange and coming to an agreement with HMRC". [14]  Another report by the same newspaper in August 2014 stated that" Care UK has not paid a penny in corporation tax since it was bought by the private equity firm  Bridgepoint Capital  in 2010. [15]

ITV’s Exposure programme  in July 2015 highlighted the urgent care centre run by the firm at  Ealing Hospital . It produced a catalogue of atrocities:

It is also alleged that staff register the discharge of patients before they have been treated to avoid breaching the  4 hour wait target . [17]

Ealing  Clinical Commissioning Group  and  Healthwatch  Ealing both investigated the situation.  Ealing Council  considered the service at a meeting of its  scrutiny committee  in September 2015. The CCG agreed to pay for an additional GP and said that the service was still considered safe. [18]
