God Bless America Again  is the nineteenth studio album by American country music singer-songwriter  Loretta Lynn . It was released on June 5, 1972, by  Decca Records . [2]  This was Lynn's third gospel album and her last album of religious material for over 20 years. Lynn's next gospel album would be the 1997 independent release,  All Time Gospel Favorites .

The title song was cowritten by  Bobby Bare  and has apparently led some to mislabel this release as a collection of patriotic songs. Largely consisting of new material, the album also includes a few well-known songs, including "Softly and Tenderly", "Just a Closer Walk with Thee", and "If God Is Dead (Who's That Living in My Soul)". Lynn wrote two songs for the album, "Working for the Lord" and "I Pray My Way Out of Trouble".

The album peaked at No. 7 on the  Billboard   Top Country Albums  chart, an impressive chart performance considering no singles were released from the album.

Recording sessions for the album took place two years before the album was released. The first session was on April 8, 1970, at Bradley's Barn in Mount Juliet, TN. Two additional sessions followed on July 15 and August 12, 1970. [3]
