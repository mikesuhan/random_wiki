John McDonnell  (born July 2, 1938) is the retired  head coach  for the  University of Arkansas   Razorbacks   track  team. He began as the  cross country  and track head coach for the University in 1972 and became head track coach in 1978. McDonnell retired after the 2008 NCAA Outdoor Championships.

McDonnell earned his bachelor's degree from Southwestern Louisiana (now  Louisiana-Lafayette ) in 1969, while competing to become a six-time all-American in track and cross country at USL, become the 1966-67 AAU 3,000-meter champion, and won the mile at the 1966 British Selection Games.

He coached at  New Providence (N.J.) High School  (1969–70) and  Lafayette (La.) High School  (1971) before coming to the University of Arkansas.

McDonnell was hired as the cross country coach in 1972 and added the entire men's track and field program in 1978.

Coach McDonnell led the track team to their first national championship at the 1984 NCAA Indoor Championships while the school was a member of the now-defunct Southwest Conference. Since then, the University of Arkansas has won 40 NCAA championships, including 11 cross country, 19 indoor track and 10 outdoor track. Other schools have won only 24 combined NCAA titles in the three sports during the same period.

McDonnell's 40 national championships (which include 19 in indoor track, 10 in outdoor track and 11 in cross country) are more than any coach in any sport in the history of college athletics.
