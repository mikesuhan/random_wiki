A native of  Madison, Alabama , Ragland attended  Bob Jones High School , where he was a varsity player in both football and  basketball . [1]  As a sophomore, he played  small forward  on a basketball team that upset No. 1  Homewood  to win the 2009–10  AHSAA  Class 6A Championship, with  Levi Randolph  being named MVP. [2]  Meanwhile, on the football field Ragland had 40 receptions as a tight end and six touchdowns. Mostly playing defense as a junior, Ragland accounted for 91 tackles in 2010 with 21 tackles for loss. Bob Jones went 8–4 over the season, losing 21–28 to  Clay-Chalkville  in the first round of the 6A playoffs. [3]  In his senior season, Ragland was credited with 97 tackles with 22 tackles for loss and six sacks. The Patriots allowed only 13 points per game and were 10–2 on the season, losing to the eventual 6A state runner-up  Hoover  in the second round of the playoffs. Ragland was also on the Patriots  track & field  team, where he competed in the  discus throw  (94 ft 8 in) [4]  and the  shot put  (45 ft 5 in) [5]

Regarded as a four-star recruit by  Rivals.com , Ragland was listed as the No. 1 inside linebacker prospect in his class. [6]  Shortly after his junior season, he committed to Alabama over  Auburn ,  Florida , and  Tennessee . [7]

As a  true freshman  on  Alabama's 2012 championship team , Ragland played in 10 games, primarily on special teams, and was credited with eight tackles, include five solo stops, and a forced fumble. In his sophomore season, he appeared in 13 games, and compiled 17 tackles on the season as a back-up to  C. J. Mosley . Both he and  Reuben Foster  were the leading candidates to replace Mosley at the “Will” linebacker spot in Alabama's  3–4 defense . [8]  Ragland eventually won out over Foster, starting all but one game for the Crimson Tide in 2014. He recorded 95 tackles on the season, which ranked second on the team behind only  Landon Collins . Ragland also had 10.5 tackles for loss (−27 yards), 1.5 sacks (−12 yards), and a team-high three fumble recoveries. He was named SEC Defensive Player of the Week after a career-high 13 tackles against  Louisiana State . [9]

In March 2016, Ragland was predicted as a mid-first round pick in the  2016 NFL Draft . [10] [11] [12]  Prior to the draft, however, medical exams revealed Ragland having an enlarged  aorta . Although reports stated this will not affect his football career, several teams had lowered Ragland on their draft boards as a result. [13]

He was eventually drafted by the  Buffalo Bills  in the 2nd round, 41st overall. The Bills traded their 2nd round pick (49th overall), their first fourth round pick (117th overall), and their 2017 4th round pick to the  Chicago Bears  for the 41st overall pick. [16]  On August 5, 2016, during training camp, Ragland suffered an injury to the left knee that turned out to be a  torn ACL ; and as a result he missed the entire  2016 NFL season . [17]  On August 30, 2016, Ragland was officially placed on injured reserve. [18]
