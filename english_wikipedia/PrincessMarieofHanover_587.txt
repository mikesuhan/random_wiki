Princess Marie of Hanover  ( German :  Marie Ernestine Josephine Adolphine Henrietta Theresa Elizabeth Alexandrina Prinzessin von Hannover und Cumberland ; 2 December 1849 â€“ 4 June 1904) was the younger daughter of King  George V of Hanover  and of his wife, Princess  Marie of Saxe-Altenburg .

Marie was born in the city of  Hanover . She held the title of Princess with the style of  Royal Highness  in the  Kingdom of Hanover . In the  United Kingdom , she held the title of Princess with the style  Her Highness  as a male line great-granddaughter of King  George III .

In 1866 Marie's father was deposed as king of Hanover. Marie and her mother remained in Hanover for over a year, residing at Schloss Marienburg, until they went into exile in  Austria  in July 1867. [1]  Eventually the family settled at  Gmunden .

Marie visited  England  with her family in May 1876, [2]  and again, after her father's death, in June 1878. [3]  Her sister  Frederica  moved to England where she married, but Marie returned to Gmunden where she remained single and lived with her mother at Schloss Cumberland (named after her father's British ducal title). An American newspaper suggests that Marie twice turned down an offer of marriage from  Queen Victoria 's third son the  Duke of Connaught . [4]

Marie died at  Gmunden  at the age of 54. Her funeral was the day after her death since two days later her niece  Princess Alexandra of Hanover and Cumberland  was scheduled to marry Grand Duke  Friedrich Franz IV of Mecklenburg-Schwerin . [5]  Marie is buried in the family mausoleum at Schloss Cumberland next to her mother who outlived her by three years.
