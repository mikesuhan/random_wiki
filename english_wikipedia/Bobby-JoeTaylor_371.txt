Bobby-Joe Taylor  (born 4 February 1995) is an  English  professional  footballer  who plays as a  midfielder  for  Aldershot Town .

After youth spells with  Chelsea  and  Gillingham , Taylor joined  Cambridge United  in 2011. On 16 February 2013, Taylor made his Cambridge debut in their 3–1 away defeat against  Mansfield Town  replacing  Jamie Reed  in the 89th minute. [1]  After a first-team breakthrough in the previous season, Taylor instead enjoyed loan spells at  Southern League Premier Division  sides;  St Neots Town  and  Arlesey Town  during the 2013–14 campaign, in which he made a total of 25 appearances, scoring twice. [2]

On 30 August 2014, Taylor made his  Football League  debut in Cambridge's 5–0 victory over  Carlisle United , replacing  Ryan Donaldson  with five minutes remaining. [3]

[5]  On 7 March 2015, Taylor scored his first goal for the club in their 4–1 away victory against  Wealdstone , coming off the bench to seal Bishop's Stortford's fourth of the game. [6]

Taylor joined  Maidstone United  on a one-year contract in June 2015. [7]  In a first season that Taylor admitted was difficult at times, the left winger played his way into first team contention at just the right time, being an unlikely deputy at right back due to an injury to  Callum Driver  at the back end of the season. Taylor went on to star in the club's  National League South  play off semi final games against  Truro City , [8]  back in his more natural left wing position, and scored a goal in the playoff final against  Ebbsfleet United .

[11]  Taylor went onto score seven more league goals, finishing the season just one behind top goalscorer;  Jamar Loza . [12]  After an impressive campaign, Taylor received his first  England C  call-up along with team-mate Kevin Lokko for their fixtures against  Panjab  and  Jersey . [13]  On 17 May 2017, it was announced that Taylor would leave the club after failing to agree a new deal. [14]
