Botan Rice Candy  is a soft, chewy, slightly lemon-orange flavored candy with an outer layer of  rice paper . The rice paper is clear and plastic-like when dry, but it is edible and dissolves in the mouth. It is a traditional Japanese candy, and it is currently imported to  North America  from  Japan  by  JFC International . [1]

Botan Rice Candies come in a small cardboard box which contains 3/4 oz. (21 grams) of candy. Each box contains six individual pieces and a sticker. [1]  Prior to 1998, each box contained a small plastic toy. The candy's name, Botan (kanji: 牡丹, hiragana: ぼたん), means " peony " in Japanese. A peony blossom is shown on the label, next to an inu- hariko , a dog-shaped traditional toy for Japanese children.

Another brand of the same candy is Tomoe Ame, with similar taste, packaging, and insert stickers.

In Japan this candy is marketed under the brand of "Bontan ame". Its name is after the fact that its flavor is based on bontan (ぼんたん), which means  pomelo .
