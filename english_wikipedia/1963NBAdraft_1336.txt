The  1963 NBA draft  was the 17th annual  draft  of the  National Basketball Association  (NBA). The draft was held on April 30 and May 7, 1963, before the  1963–64 season . In this  draft , nine NBA teams took turns selecting amateur U.S.  college basketball  players. A player who had finished his four-year college eligibility was eligible for selection. If a player left college early, he would not be eligible for selection until his college class graduated. In each round, the teams select in reverse order of their win–loss record in the  previous season . Before the draft, a team could forfeit its first-round draft pick and then select any player from within a 50-mile radius of its home arena as their  territorial pick . [1] [2]  The  Chicago Zephyrs  relocated to  Baltimore  and became the  Baltimore Bullets  prior to the draft. [3]  The  Syracuse Nationals  participated in the draft, but relocated to  Philadelphia  and became the  Philadelphia 76ers  prior to the start of the season. [4]  The draft consisted of 15 rounds comprising 84 players selected. 
This draft holds the record for the least number of non-territorial picks who later debuted in the NBA, with 17 (18 if the territorial pick Tom Thacker is included).

Tom Thacker  from the  University of Cincinnati  was selected before the draft as  Cincinnati Royals ' territorial pick.  Art Heyman  from  Duke University  was selected  first overall  by the  New York Knicks . Two players from this draft,  Nate Thurmond  and  Gus Johnson , have been inducted to the  Basketball Hall of Fame . [5]  Thurmond was also named in the  50 Greatest Players in NBA History  list announced at the league's 50th anniversary in 1996. [6]  Thurmond's achievements include seven  All-Star Game selections  and five  All-Defensive Team  selections. [7]  Johnson's achievement include four  All-NBA Team  selections and five All-Star Game selections. [8]  Two players from this draft, 4th pick  Eddie Miles  and 13th pick  Jim King , have also been selected to an All-Star Game. [9] [10]

Reggie Harding , who was the first  player drafted out of high school  when he was drafted  the previous year , was drafted again by the  Detroit Pistons  with the 48th pick. He finally enter the league after spending a year in  Midwest Professional Basketball League  (MPBL) due to the rules that prevent a high school player to play in the league until one year after his high school class graduated. [11] [12]   Larry Brown  from the  University of North Carolina  was selected with the 55th pick. However, he never played in the NBA. He spent his playing career within the  Amateur Athletic Union  (AAU) before joining the newly formed  American Basketball Association  (ABA) in 1967. [13]  He played there for five seasons, earning one All-ABA Team selection and three ABA All-Star Game selections. [14]  After his playing career, he became a head coach. He coached nine NBA teams, most recently with the  Charlotte Bobcats . He won the NBA championship with the  Detroit Pistons  in  2004  and went to the  NBA Finals  two other times; with the  Philadelphia 76ers  in  2001  and with the Pistons in  2005 . [15]  In between his NBA coaching career, he also coached the  Kansas Jayhawks  of the  University of Kansas  for five seasons, winning the  National Collegiate Athletic Association  (NCAA)  championship  in  1988 . He is the only coach to win both an NCAA title and an NBA championship. As a player, he won the  gold medal  with the  United States national basketball team  at the  1964 Olympic Games . He then coached the U.S. national team to a  bronze medal  at the  2004 Olympic Games , becoming the only U.S. male basketball participant to both play and coach in the Olympics. [16]   Rod Thorn , the 2nd pick, also had a coaching career. He was the interim head coach of the  Chicago Bulls  in  1982 . [17]
