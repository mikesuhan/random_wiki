Weight-shift control  as a means of  aircraft flight control  is widely used in  hang gliders ,  powered hang gliders , and  ultralight trikes . Control is usually by the pilot using his or her weight against a triangular control bar that is rigidly attached to the wing structure. The wing is mounted on a pivot above the trike carriage or hang glider harness allowing the weight-shift forces to produce changes in pitch and bank. [1]
