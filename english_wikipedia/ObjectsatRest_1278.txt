" Objects at Rest " is the penultimate episode from the fifth season of the science-fiction television series  Babylon 5 .

Delenn  and  Sheridan  relocate to  Minbar ;  Lennier  betrays Sheridan when an accident takes place on board the Minbari cruiser transporting him and Delenn to Minbar.

Michael Garibaldi  arrives on Mars, and begins a series of shakeups at Edgars Industries. Since he had fired the previous board of directors, Garibaldi assembles a new board that is composed of company troublemakers. He empowers them to challenge any of Garibaldi's decisions any one of them may disagree with. If they prove to be correct, they will receive a bonus, but if Garibaldi proves to be right, "I will eat you for lunch."

Sheridan and Delenn leave Babylon 5 in order to relocate the new offices on Minbar. Emperor Mollari (under control of the  Drakh ) presents Sheridan with an urn which is meant to be given to Sheridan's son on his 16th birthday. The urn contains a  Keeper . According to creator J. Michael Straczynski, it is this Keeper that causes the incident that is mentioned in " The Deconstruction of Falling Stars " - the immediate aftermath of which is detailed in " War Without End ". Plus,  Morden's  revelation in  Day Of The Dead  comes true with Lennier betraying the Rangers.

This was the final episode of  Babylon 5  produced. A week after this episode aired, the final episode (which had been produced during season 4) aired, " Sleeping in Light ", ending the five-year run of the series.
