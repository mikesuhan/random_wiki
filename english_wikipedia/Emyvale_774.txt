Emyvale , known before the  Plantation of Ulster  as  Scarnageeragh [1]  ( Irish :  Scairbh na gCaorach , meaning "shallow ford of the sheep"), is a village and  townland  in the north of  County Monaghan ,  Ireland . It is on the main  Dublin  to  Derry  and  Letterkenny  road, the ( N2 ), about 10 km (6 miles) north of  Monaghan  and 8 km (5 miles) south of  Aughnacloy . Its population is about 800.

In 1959, a  Bronze Age   tomb  was discovered which proved that there was a settlement at the site of the village more than 3,000 years ago. Unfortunately for historians, the  urn  and other artifacts found were inadvertently destroyed during excavation of the tomb. The name  Scairbh na gCaorach  (the  Irish language  name for Emyvale) means 'crossing of the sheep', referring to a low (and easily traversable) point in the Mountain Water river on which Emyvale is situated.

The name is thought to have come from the Ui Meith tribe, the village's first inhabitants. Scairbh na gCaorach was abbreviated to "Scarna" in the early part of the 19th Century (indeed a local hostelry bears this name), although this fell out of common usage and village is now referred to by its  English language  name – Emyvale. In the 8th century, the  McKenna  Clan arrived and, by the 12th century, they had established an independent  túath  or kingdom in  North Monaghan  which would last for the next 450 years.

In more recent times, Emyvale was immortalised by the renowned 19th-century Irish writer  William Carleton  as part of his  Traits and Stories of the Irish Peasantry  series. The volume, which included  The Fair at Emyvale  (a short story based upon Carleton's experiences of the north Monaghan landscape where he was educated as a young man), is recognised as one of the most significant commentaries on Irish life in the Victorian Era.
