William James Gordon   VC  (19 May 1864 â€“ 15 August 1922) was a  West Indian  recipient of the  Victoria Cross , the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to  British  and  Commonwealth  forces.

He was 27 years old, and a  Lance-Corporal  in the  West India Regiment ,  British Army  during the  Second Gambia Campaign  when, on 13 March 1892 at  Toniataba ,  Gambia , the major who was in command of the troops was superintending a party of 12 men who were trying, with a heavy beam, to break down the south gate of the town. Suddenly a number of musket-muzzles appeared through a double row of loopholes, some of them being only two or three yards from the major's back and before he realised what had happened, Gordon threw himself between the major and the muskets, pushing the officer out of the way. At the same moment the NCO was shot through the lungs. He later achieved the rank of  sergeant . The medal is on display at the  Jamaica Defence Force Museum . [1]
