Stan Getz & Bill Evans  is an album by  jazz   saxophonist   Stan Getz  and  pianist   Bill Evans  recorded in 1964 for the  Verve  label, but not released until 1973 as V6-8833. [1]  It would also be released in 1974 as  Previously Unreleased Recordings  (MV 2087). [2]

The  Allmusic  review by Ken Dryden awarded the album 4 stars and states "It is peculiar that Verve shelved the results for over a decade before issuing any of the music, though it may have been felt that Getz and Evans hadn't had enough time to achieve the desired chemistry, though there are memorable moments".
