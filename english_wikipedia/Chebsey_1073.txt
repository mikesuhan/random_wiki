Chebsey  is a small village in  Staffordshire  2.5 miles southeast of  Eccleshall  on a confluence of  Eccleshall  water and the  River Sow  some 5 miles northwest of  Stafford . The population of the  civil parish  at the  2011 census  was 566. [1]  It comprises a number of houses and cottages and a village church dedicated to  All Saints .

Standing above the village on a natural mound of higher ground, the church is mostly built from reddish sandstone in the  Gothic  style and dates from the 12th century. The west tower dates from the 15th century, and is constructed from mostly grey with some red sandstone blocks. The external staircase  turret  (on the southeast corner of the tower) at Chebsey, is quite an unusual feature. Though it is very common in the churches of the  South of England  and especially those of  Devon  and  Somerset , [2]  yet it is rarely seen in churches of the  English Midlands  and  North of England . Parts of the south wall of the church show signs of extensive repairs, mostly in red sandstone. The churchyard contains an  Anglo-Saxon  cross shaft. [3]  Inside the church can be found  late Victorian stained glass  windows by  Charles Eamer Kempe , and a 13th-century stone coffin. [4]  The church was extensively renovated in 1897 under the supervision of  Staffordshire  ecclesiastical architect Andrew Capper. [5]  The churchyard contains the  war graves  of a soldier of  World War I  and an  airman  of  World War II . [6]
