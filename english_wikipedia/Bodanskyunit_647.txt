The  Bodansky unit  is an obsolete measure of  alkaline phosphatase  concentration in blood. It is defined as  the quantity of alkaline phosphatase that liberates 1mg of phosphate ion during the first hour of incubation with a buffered substrate containing sodium Î²-glycerophosphate. [1]  This technique was the first test to measure blood alkaline phosphatase levels, and was developed by  Aaron Bodansky  in the early 1930s. [2]
