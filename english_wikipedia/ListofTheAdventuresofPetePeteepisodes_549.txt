The following is a list of episodes from the  Nickelodeon   television series ,  The Adventures of Pete & Pete .

The series began on November 28, 1993 and ended on December 28, 1996. A total of 34 episodes have aired as well as 5 half-hour specials and 26 shorts. Currently, the first two seasons are available on DVD. The third season was planned for release but has been removed from Paramount's release schedule.

(Note: The original broadcast order is not known. However, "What Would You Do for a Dollar?" and "Freeze Tag" were the two earliest.)

These episodes, while originally aired before the official run of the series, were modified to resemble regular episodes during the show's run with the addition of the opening credits.

After the Petes and Ellen unintentionally drive Mr. Tastee (the local ice-cream man) out of town by trying to find out about his personal life, they start a hunt to find him and bring him back as the summer comes to a close.

On his way to school, Little Pete happens upon a  garage band  playing his favorite song: "Summerbaby" by  Polaris . When he returns later that day, all traces of the band have vanished; Pete starts his own  band  to try to find themâ€”and his song.

In season three the focus of the series began skewing somewhat towards Little Pete; notably, Little Pete even narrates an episode for the first time since the special "New Year's Pete".

Little Pete attends his first school dance and Big Pete develops a crush on the guitarist of the hired band ( Luscious Jackson ). Pit Stain learns of Little Pete's fear of dancing and tries to exploit it, and Nona tries to avoid the embarrassment of dancing with her "Pop," ( Iggy Pop ) who takes the stage and sings a song for her. Little Pete overcomes his fear of dancing and dances with Nona.
