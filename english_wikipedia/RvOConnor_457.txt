R v O'Connor , [1995] 4  S.C.R.  411 is a leading  Supreme Court of Canada  decision on disclosure of  medical records . The Court held that the medical and counselling records of a complainant in a sexual assault case that are held by a third party can be disclosed by order of the judge if they meet two requirements.

First, the applicant must establish, without seeing them, that the records are likely to be relevant to the case. Second, the judge must review the records and decide whether to disclose them based on the balancing the right to make full answer and defence, and the right to  privacy .

The O'Connor involved in the case was  Hubert Patrick O'Connor , a  Catholic  bishop from  British Columbia  who was found guilty sex crimes in 1991. [1]
