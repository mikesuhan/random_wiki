In mathematics, a  pantachy  or  pantachie  (from the Greek word πανταχη meaning everywhere) is a maximal totally ordered  subset  of a  partially ordered set , especially a set of equivalence classes of sequences of real numbers. The term was introduced by  du Bois-Reymond  ( 1879 ,  1882 ) to mean a  dense subset  of an ordered set, and he also introduced "infinitary pantachies" to mean the ordered set of equivalence classes of real functions ordered by domination, but as  Felix Hausdorff  pointed out this is not a totally ordered set.  Hausdorff (1907)  redefined a pantachy to be a maximal totally ordered subset of this set.
