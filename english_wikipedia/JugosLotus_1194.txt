Jugos Lotus , (English: Lotus Juice ), often shortened to  Lotus , is a Puerto Rican juice brand that is sold mainly in  Puerto Rico , the  American   eastern seaboard  and some other  Caribbean  countries. At first only offering pineapple flavored juice, Jugos Lotus has expanded its flavor range in recent years.

In 1892, Jugos Lotus became an established drink in the Puerto Rican food and drink market. This was six years before  Spain  ceded the small Caribbean country to the United States.

In 1991, a company named Campo Fresco established a juice plant in  Santa Isabel , a southern Puerto Rican city , [1]  later buying the Lotus juice brand directly from the government of Puerto Rico in 1998. [2]

In 2014, the brand introduced two new flavors, guava and pear. [3]
