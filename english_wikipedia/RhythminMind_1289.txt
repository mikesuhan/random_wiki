Rhythm in Mind  is an album by saxophonist  Steve Coleman  that was recorded in 1991 and released by  Novus Records . [1] [2]

Scott Yanow  of  Allmusic  gave the album three stars, stating, "The music is essentially a quirky version of straight-ahead jazz with generally strong solos from the diverse players, hints of Coleman's M-Base music, and some blues. Intriguing but not essential." [3]
