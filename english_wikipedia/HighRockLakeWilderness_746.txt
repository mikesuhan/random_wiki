The  High Rock Lake Wilderness  is a wilderness area in  Nevada  containing the northern portion of the  Calico Hills . High Rock Lake, for which the wilderness was named, was created about 11,800 years ago after a large  rockslide  closed the outlet (Box Canyon) to High Rock and Little High Rock Canyons. This new outlet (Fly Canyon) cut a narrow canyon that empties at Soldier Meadows. One special geological feature in Fly Canyon is the  potholes . The potholes were carved by  whirlpool  action of sand and gravel in the stream. Another unique feature is the Fly Slide where emigrants lowered their wagons with ropes into Fly Canyon portion of the  Applegate-Lassen Trail . Elevations in the wilderness range from 4,000 to 7,660 ft (1,220 to 2,330 m) with scattered vegetation of  saltbrush  and  sagebrush . [1]

The wilderness area is managed by the  Bureau of Land Management . [2]
