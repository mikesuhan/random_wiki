The Baloch also inhabit the  Iranian Baluchistan  as a small  ethnic minority  and have settled in other areas of the Middle East, notably in  Oman ,  Yemen , and the  UAE . The Arabised Baloches, are now believed to represent almost 30% of the local population of Oman. [ citation needed ]  According to Dr. Akhtar Baloch,  Professor  at  University of Karachi , the Balochis migrated from  Balochistan  during the  Little Ice Age  and settled in  Sindh  and  Punjab . The Little Ice Age is conventionally defined as a period extending from the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries, [11] [12] [13]  or alternatively, from about 1300 [14]  to about 1850. [15] [16] [17]  Although climatologists and historians working with local records no longer expect to agree on either the start or end dates of this period, which varied according to local conditions. According to Professor Baloch, the climate of Balochistan was very cold and the region was inhabitable during the winter so the Baloch people migrated in waves and settled in  Sindh  and  Punjab .
