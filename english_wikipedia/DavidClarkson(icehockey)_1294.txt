David Clarkson  (born March 31, 1984) is a Canadian  ice hockey   forward  for the  Vegas Golden Knights  of the  National Hockey League  (NHL) and is the head coach for the Upper Arlington Golden Bears ice hockey team. Clarkson was a member of the  2003 Memorial Cup -winning  Kitchener Rangers .

Following his junior career, Clarkson went undrafted and was signed as a free agent by the  New Jersey Devils  on August 12, 2005. He was assigned to the  Albany River Rats  of the  AHL  in September of that year. He would go on to play the majority of the 2006–2007 season with the Devils' new farm team, the  Lowell Devils  (also of the AHL), before receiving a late-season call-up to New Jersey.

Clarkson made his NHL debut on March 15, 2007, at  Carolina . He scored his first NHL goal one game later in a 7–2 loss to the Carolina Hurricanes. He would go on to finish the season with New Jersey, including three playoff games, and start the next season in the NHL.

Clarkson played in the YoungStars Game during the  56th NHL All-Star Game SuperSkills Competition , scoring one goal and two assists. He was the lone Devils' representative at the festivities, as  Martin Brodeur  (who had been voted in) was unable to participate.

Clarkson ranked seventh in the  NHL  in penalty minutes (183) during the  2007–08  season. On July 1, as a restricted free agent, Clarkson was re-signed by the Devils for two years at $800,000 per year.

As the  NHL lock-out  began, Clarkson signed with  Austrian  team  EC Red Bull Salzburg  to begin the 2012–13 season. Once the NHL lock-out was settled, he returned to the Devils and did well offensively, scoring 15 points in 12 games before slumping and only recording another nine points in the remaining 36 games as New Jersey failed to the make the playoffs.

An  unrestricted free agent , Clarkson did not re-sign with the Devils during the offseason, instead signing a seven-year $36.75 million contract with the  Toronto Maple Leafs  on July 5, 2013. [1]  On September 22, 2013, a brawl erupted during a  preseason  game against the  Buffalo Sabres  during which Clarkson left the bench to fight. He subsequently received an automatic 10-game  suspension  from the NHL. Clarkson ended his first season in Toronto with five goals and 11 points in 60 games.

In the midst of his second season with the Maple Leafs in the  2014–15  season, and unable to establish a level of play to match his contract, Clarkson was traded by Toronto to the  Columbus Blue Jackets  in exchange for  Nathan Horton  on February 26, 2015. [2]  Healthy scratches and injuries would hold Clarkson to only 26 games with the Blue Jackets over the next year and a half.

As training camp for the  2016–17 season  approached, it was announced that Clarkson had failed a physical and would not be invited to practice with the Blue Jackets. [3]  He was placed on the long-term injured reserve and ruled out for the entirety of the season, unofficially retiring from playing professionally.

On June 21, 2017, Clarkson's contract was obtained by the  Vegas Golden Knights  at the  2017 NHL Expansion Draft  in a pre-arraigned trade with the Blue Jackets in order for the Golden Knights to select  William Karlsson . [4]

Clarkson was born in  Etobicoke ,  Ontario , a suburb of  Toronto , growing up in the  Mimico  neighbourhood. He and his wife Brittney have two children, McKinley and Colton. Clarkson initially served as an assistant coach for the Upper Arlington high school hockey team before taking on the head coaching job the following year from 2017. [5]
