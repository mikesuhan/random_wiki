Perito Moreno  is a town in the northwest of  Santa Cruz Province , Argentina, 25 km east of  Lake Buenos Aires . It should not be confused with the  Perito Moreno National Park  over 300 km south by road, or the  Perito Moreno Glacier  near  El Calafate . The town is the capital of the  Lago Buenos Aires Department . It lies on the RN43, a paved road which links  Caleta Olivia  on the Atlantic coast to  Los Antiguos  and the  Chilean  frontier 60 km west, and  Ruta 40 , running north and south.

The town is a centre of cattle ranches and smallholdings producing fruit and vegetables. Tourism is also an important industry. Perito Moreno is the closest town to  Cueva de las Manos , 170 km south by road, and Parque Laguna.

In the 2010 census the town had a population of 4,617. [1]

The town was founded in 1910, as a rest stop for travellers by the springs which give rise to the  Rio Deseado . The place was called Pari-Aike (meaning "place of reeds") by the  Tehuelche , but the town was officially called Nacimiento in 1927. The name was changed in 1944 to Lago Buenos Aires, and in 1952 to Perito Moreno, after the explorer  Francisco Moreno .
