Riegeldale Tavern  is a  restaurant  located in  Trion  on Old Highway 27 in Northwest  Georgia , United States. It is surrounded by the  Appalachian Mountains  along with the  Chattooga River . [1]

In 1912, Benjamin D. Riegel, owner of the Trion mill, [2]  came up with the idea of the tavern. He wanted a place where traveling tourists coming through the area could have an eating place. His wife also wanted a place where friends and guests could mingle with one another. [1]  Riegel talked to his son-in-law, Clarence Jones (an architect), about building a place to sell their products and at the same time, an eating place for guests and tourists. [1]  The building itself was constructed in 1936 within six weeks, with the gardens being completed in the spring of 1937. [2]

Jones visited Europe and several other countries for the design of the tavern. The architecture consisted of four dormer windows on each side with sloping roofs that had gabled ends. [3] [4]  The back porch was made of sandstone. On the outside, there was a lamppost near the entrance at the driveway. [5]

The tavern's food has won several awards. One of the awards is  Whoâ€™s Who  in Ford Times published by the Ford Motor Company in the mid 1900s. The most delicate meal served was  The Ole Tavern Baked Eggplant . [6]   Duncan Hines , a restaurant-reviewer, [7]  wrote a paragraph on the tavern in the 1959 edition of his  Adventures in Good Eating  travel-guide. He wrote that they had "sizzling steaks, homemade bread, waffles and country ham." [8]

Banquets were held at the tavern on several occasions. The most recognized organization to hold a banquet at the tavern was the Summerville Trion Rotary Club. Throughout the year, several organizations would meet for business meetings at the tavern. [9]
