Andrew Egan  (c.1810 – 9 October 1863) was an Irish  architect  and  builder .

Egan was a member of a noted  County Galway  family,  Mac Aodhagáin . He is thought to have been born on  Tuam 's Old Road or at Cloonsheen. His father was a  stonemason  and he had siblings Patrick, Thomas, Bridget and Elizabeth. He began his apprenticship in 1826, the same year as the foundation stone of Tuam's new Catholic Cathedral. By the late 1830s, Egan had progressed far enough to be entrusted with a supervisory role in the erection of the Bell Tower of the cathedral.

In 1838, the local  Roman Catholic  Free School was constructed, and it is believed that Egan was the contractor. By 1839 he was classed a  Master Builder  and was optaining commissions from Tuam diocese. He married Margaret Lyons of Tuam on 20 October 1839. Their children were Mary Jane (born 1841, died young), William (1843), Thomas Andrew (1847), John Joseph (1852), Emilea Patricia (1854), Isabel Cecily (1857) and Mary, who also died young.

From 1839 until his death, Egan was in continuous work. His most notable work was Tuam Town Hall, the foundation stone been laid in 1857. Others include the  Glenamaddy  workhouse, the bridge at  Dunmore , the Presentation Convent, the  Presbytery , as well as houses for middle-class and gentry families - Castlegrove, Toghermore, Oakmount and Brownesgrove. In addition, he was responsible for constructing various properties in the suburbs, Dublin Road, Waterslade Place, Foster Terrace, Eastland Row, the Square. Because of this, he is considered 'the builder of Tuam'.

In addition, his obituary stated that he was responsible for erecting nearly all the churches, convents and public buildings within twenty miles of Tuam. These include Kilbannon church.
