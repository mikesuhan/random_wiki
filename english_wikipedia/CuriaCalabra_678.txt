The  Curia Calabra  was a religious station or  templum  used for the ritual observation of the  new moon  in  ancient Rome . Although its exact location is unclear, it was most likely a roofless enclosure in front of an augural hut  ( auguraculum ) , on the southwest flank of the  Area Capitolina , the precinct of  Temple of Capitoline Jupiter .  Servius  identifies the Curia Calabra with a  Casa Romuli  ("Hut of  Romulus ") on the  Capitoline , [1]  but  Macrobius  implies that it was adjacent to the  Casa . [2]

The  Roman calendar  was originally  lunar . On the  Kalends  or first day of each month, the  pontifex minor  occupied the Curia Calabra to await the sighting of the new moon. The  Rex Sacrificulus  and the pontifex then carried out a  res divina  (religious service) and sacrifice in honor of  Juno , and the Roman people were called to assembly  (in  comitia calata ) . Like  calata , the name  Calabra  probably derives from  calare , "to summon" or "proclaim". [3]
