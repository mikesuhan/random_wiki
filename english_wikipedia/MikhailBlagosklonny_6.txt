Mikhail Blagosklonny  is a scientist who studies  cancer  and  aging . He was formerly a  professor  of  oncology  at the  Roswell Park Cancer Institute  in New York. [1]

Blagosklonny earned both his  M.D.  in internal medicine and his  PhD  in experimental medicine and cardiology from the  First Pavlov State Medical University of St. Peterburg . [1]  He was appointed associate professor of medicine at  New York Medical College , Valhalla, NY in 2002 before taking a position as a senior scientist at Ordway Research Institute ( Albany, New York ). Blagosklonny held this position until 2009 when he was appointed professor of oncology at  Roswell Park Cancer Institute . [1]

Blogosklonny's research interests include cancer and targeted cancer therapies that protect normal cells from damage, as well as the underlying mechanisms of aging ( biogerontology ) and anti-aging drugs. [1]

Blagosklonny has formulated a hypothesis about the possible role of  TOR signaling  in aging and cancer and proposed using  rapamycin , a popular cancer drug as a possible treatment for life extension. [2]  He is considered one of the most passionate advocates for rapamycin in longevity research. [3]

Blagosklonny is  editor-in-chief  of  Aging , [4]   Cell Cycle , [5]  and  Oncotarget . [6]  In addition, he is associate editor of  Cancer Biology & Therapy [7]  and a member of the  editorial board  of  Cell Death & Differentiation . [8]

The reviewing process employed by  Oncotarget  has been criticized by  Jeffrey Beall , [9]  who also included  Oncotarget  and  Aging  on his list of  "potential, possible, or probable predatory scholarly open-access journals" [10]  in July 2015. [9]  Further reports on Beall's blog suggest that the substandard peer review processes for these journals are used by their respective editor-in-chief to entice prospective authors to include references to Blagosklonny's own publications in their articles (following the peer review), thereby raising his personal impact factor. [11]

Blagosklonny has published over 270 papers in peer-reviewed journals with over 25,000 citations, giving him an  h-index  of 83. [12]
