Desktop Theater  was a  digital performance  project created by Adriene Jenik and Lisa Brenneis that ran from 1997 to 2002. The project consisted of a series of early experiments in network performances using online discussion rooms and visual chat applications such as  The Palace . [1]  The objective was to introduce a compelling way for the public to interact with theater online and the audiences responses in the chat room were seen as an important element of the work. [2]  The project created over 40 web-based performances during its lifetime. [3] [4] [5]

Using  The Palace , the company would enter the online environment and using avatars, create adaptations of stage performances. One adaptation performed was  waitingforgodot.com,  based on  Waiting for Godot  by  Samuel Beckett . [6]  Everything that would conventionally be seen on a live stage (e.g. scenery, gestures, emotions, and speech) was compressed into  2D  and computer speech. [7]  This subgenre of digital performance is also known as  cyberformance .

Besides adaptations of plays, the Desktop Theater project also created improvisations, activities, active verses, and workshops. With each work, the project strove to eliminate the distance between performer and audience. [8]
