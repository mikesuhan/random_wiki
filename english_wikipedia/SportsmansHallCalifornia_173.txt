Sportsmans Hall  (also,  Sportsman's Hall ) [1]  is a former settlement in  El Dorado County ,  California . [2]  It was located 11 miles (18Â km) east of  Placerville [2]  and now resides in the community of Pollock Pines.

It is the site of California Registered Historical Landmark #704, which reads: "This was the site of Sportsman's Hall, also known as Twelve-Mile House, the hotel operated in the latter 1850s and 1860s by John and James Blair. A stopping place for stages and teams of the Comstock, it became a relay station of the Central Overland Pony Express. Here, at 7:40 A.M., April 4, 1860, pony rider William (Sam) Hamilton riding in from Placerville, handed the express mail to Warren Upson, who, two minutes later, sped on his way eastward." [3]

A post office operated at Youngs from 1865 to 1867. [2]  The place was named after a building used to entertain drivers who stopped there. [2]
