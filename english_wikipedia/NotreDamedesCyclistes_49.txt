The chapel of  Notre-Dame des Cyclistes  is situated in the commune of  Labastide-d'Armagnac  in  Les Landes   département  in  Aquitaine , France.

The chapel is all that remains of a 12th-century fortress of the  Knights Templar . The Château de Géou was razed by the  Black Prince  in 1355.

It was listed as a  monument historique  by the  French Ministry of Culture  on 27 February 1996. [1]

On 22 August 1958, Father Joseph Massie, pastor of  Créon-d'Armagnac ,  Mauvezin-d'Armagnac  and  Lagrange , was inspired by the chapel of  Madonna del Ghisallo  in Italy to make a similar chapel for cyclists. [2]  On 18 May 1959, Pope John XXIII agreed to make the old chapel a National Sanctuary of Cycling and Cyclists under the protection of the Virgin: Our Lady of cyclists (Notre-Dame des cyclistes). [2]

The  Tour de France  has passed the chapel five times: in 1984, 1989, 1995, 2000 and 2017. There was also a departure from  Labastide-d'Armagnac  on July 9, 1989. [2] [3]

The chapel and museum is a focal point for amateur cyclists and tourists. From 1958, [ citation needed ]  it was converted into a Museum of Cycling in aid of French racing and touring cyclists. Numerous champions have donated their shirts, including  André Darrigade ,  Jacques Anquetil ,  Louison Bobet ,  Tom Simpson ,  Roger Lapébie ,  Jean Stablinski ,  Bernard Hinault ,  Raymond Poulidor ,  Eddy Merckx  and  Luis Ocaña [2]

The chapel includes a  stained glass  window designed and created by  Henri Anglade , a former rider of the Tour de France, to represent cycling. It was reportedly intended to celebrate a thaw in the intense rivalry between  Fausto Coppi  and  Gino Bartali , as they shared a bottle ( bidon ) on the  Col d'Izoard  during the  1952 Tour de France . [4]

The bicycle used in the French film  Les Cracks , directed by  Alex Joffé  in 1968, is on display at the museum.
