Joseph Schröter  (14 March 1837 – 12 December 1894) [1]  was a noted German  mycologist , doctor and scientist. [2]  During his lifetime, he wrote several books and texts, and discovered and described many species of  flora  and fungi. He also spent a considerable amount of time (around fifteen years, from 1871 to 1886) serving as a military doctor, particularly in the  Franco-Prussian War , in places such as  Spandau ,  Rastatt  and  Breslau , and rising to the rank of  colonel .

Not much is known about Joseph Schröter's childhood and youth, except that he probably spent those years in or close to Breslau, for that is where he was schooled. Similarly, not much is known about his relatives and family.

In 1855 Schröter chose to study medicine in Breslau, Poland (a city today known as  Wrocław ), but, in 1856, he transferred to the  Friedrich-Wilhelm Academy  in Berlin, Germany. [2]  In 1859 he earned his  Doctor of Medicine  degree. In the same year, he enlisted in the Prussian army, serving as a doctor in the Franco-Prussian war. [2]  He occupied this post to the end of the war, in 1871, before being stationed at Spandau, and later Rastatt. [2]  For his efforts as a doctor, as well as the various other contributions he made to the military (particularly during the Franco-Prussian War), Schröter was promoted to the rank of colonel in 1880. He was then stationed at Breslau, where he had been schooled. His career at the  University of Breslau  began six years later, in 1886, when he was appointed as a lecturer. [2]  He stayed at the university teaching for several years, and became a professor in 1890. He died in 1894, after returning from a scientific expedition to  Turkey . [2]

During his lifetime and studies, Schröter described many  genera , including:
