Arriondas  (officially, in  Asturian ,  Les Arriondes ) is a village in the  Spanish  municipality of  Parres ,  Asturias . It is located where the River Piloña joins the river Sella, in a narrow valley.

The convergence of rivers makes it an important place for fishing. The river makes a very good spot for canoeing, and every year the International Descent of the Sella is held. This consists of a canoe race down the river Sella to the coastal village of  Ribadesella . This competition brings in significant numbers of tourists. These make up one of the most important of the village's economic activities.
