The  National Mint of Xuvia  ( Spanish :  Casa de Moneda de Jubia ,  Galician :  '' Real Casa da Moeda de Xuvia'' ) was a  Spanish   mint  of  copper  coins from 1812 to 1868. [1]

The mint was established in 1790 in Xuvia (or  Jubia  in  Spanish  spelling), a  civil parish  in the municipality of  Neda , next to  Ferrol  in the province of  A Coruña  under the name of  Fábrica Nacional de Cobrería , as a copper  foundry . The foundry's original purpose was to support boat constructing in the shipyard at Ferrol, but during the war against the French in the  Peninsular War , the site became a standard  mint  producing copper coins. The  Casa de Moneda de Segovia  was in French control at the time, minting coins in the name of  Joseph Bonaparte . Xuvia, in Spanish territory, would produce coins in name of the king,  Ferdinand VII of Spain .

The first coins were minted in 1812, namely coins of eight  Spanish maravedís . In later years, coins of two and four maravedís were minted in addition to one maravedí in 1824. After 1815, the Xuvia mint began to lose importance as a direct result of the  Casa de Moneda de Segovia  beginning to re-mint coins in the name of Fernando VII. [1]  In 1819, the mint returned to manufacturing plates for the ships in the  Spanish Navy  and minting was brought to a complete standstill between 1827 and 1835, with manufacturing efforts directed to production of tin plates. [1]

The first decimal coinage of the monetary system entered into effect in 1850, having been officially agreed on in 1848. On August 28, 1850, Xuvia was instructed to finalize its manufacture of coinage. The last coins left the mint in September of that year. Notwithstanding, coins of 1, ½, 2½ and 5 céntimos were minted between 1866 and 1868. The mint was closed indefinitely in 1868, along with the mint of Segovia, and was sold at auction in 1873, later becoming a textile factory. [1]

Over half of the mint's surrounding land consists of a dense forest of  eucalyptus  trees, meadows and industrial areas. Various original structures have been preserved, particularly a  water wheel  and a canal over 900 metres (2,953 ft) in length. The building itself is currently closed to the public.
