Epicanthoplasty  is a rare  eye surgery  to modify the  epicanthal folds . It can be a challenging procedure because the epicanthal folds overlay the  lacrimal canaliculi  (tear drainage canals). [1]  Although an epicanthic fold can also be associated with a less prominent upper eyelid crease (a feature commonly termed "single eyelids" as opposed to "double eyelids"), the two features are distinct; a person may have both epicanthal folds and an upper eyelid crease, one and not the other, or neither. [2]  Single eyelids are reshaped using  double eyelid surgery .

Epicanthoplasty may leave visible post-surgical scar lines. A common corrective technique involves using  Z-plasty . [ citation needed ]
