Butler  is a locality in the Australian state of  South Australia  located on the  Eyre Peninsula  about 241 kilometres (150 miles) west of the state capital of  Adelaide  and about 31 kilometres (19 miles) north of the local government seat of  Tumby Bay . [3]

Its name and boundaries were both adopted and created in 1998. Its name is reported as being collectively derived from the Butler Tanks, a water storage facility, and the Butler Railway Station which are both located within Butler, and from the  cadastral unit  of the  Hundred of Butler  in which it is located. [2]  The name is ultimately derived from  Richard Butler , a South Australian politician. [8]

A school operated within the current boundaries of the locality from 1905 to 1968. [9]

The route of the  Cummins  to  Buckleboo  branch of the  Eyre Peninsula Railway  passes through the locality from the south-west to the north-east and includes two railway station sites - Butler and Mount Hill. [2]
