Simone Simoni  (1532,  Lucca  - 1602,  Kraków ) was an Italian philosopher and physician.

After graduating in medicine from the  University of Padua , Simoni moved to  Geneva  where he became professor of philosophy and engaged in controversy with  Jakob Schegk . Expelled by the city for his heretical views, he moved to  Paris  and subsequently to  Leipzig  (where he was accused of  Arianism  in 1575) and  Heidelberg  (where he was forced to leave in 1579). In 1581 he became court physician to  Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor  in  Prague ; there were unconfirmed rumours that he had converted to Catholicism.

Simoni moved on to  Poland  to become court physician to  Stephen Báthory . When the King died in 1586, Simoni was accused of having prescribed the wrong treatmentand after a bitter dispute his rival  Nicholas Buccella  was appointed personal physician to the new king  Sigismund III Vasa . SImoni moved to  Moravia , where he spent the rest of his life.

Simoni wrote a commentary on  Aristotle 's  De Sensu . He gave a notably crisp formulation to the principle that physicians should undergo preliminary preparation in Aristotelian  natural philosophy :  Ubi desinit physicus, ibi medicus incipit  [The physician starts where the natural philosopher leaves off].
