Boink  was a magazine of  erotica  started by Alecia Oleyourryk, a magazine journalism major at  Boston University , and photographer Christopher Anderson. The magazine was also educational in scope and purpose. The premiere issue was released in February 2005 and was celebrated with an opening party at the Roxy, a nightclub in the  Boston Theater District .

The reason that I like this magazine is that you can tell they are real college students... not those fake college students you find on the Internet. --  Howard Stern  (BU Alum)  [1]

The magazine was available in both a print and online digital version.  Boink  catered to both men and women with articles dealing with sexuality in college life. All models were students from area colleges and of varying  sexual orientations .

In 2008, a book based on the magazine was published by  Warner Books , titled  BOINK: College Sex by the People Having It."

As of 2010, the magazine has ceased publishing new issues, although the book can still be purchased online.
