Burnbank railway station  was a  railway station  which served the suburb of  Burnbank  in  Hamilton, South Lanarkshire . It is one of several railway stations to have served Hamilton, and one of three to be closed permanently.

The station was opened on 1 April 1878 as  Greenfield , and was later renamed  Burnbank . [1] [2]  The station closed on 1 January 1917, [2]  but re-opened again on 2 June 1919 [2]  along with others on the line (with the exception of  Peacock Cross ).

Originally it was served by the  Glasgow, Bothwell, Hamilton and Coatbridge Railway , and later, the  North British Railway . Under the  Railways Act 1921 , the NBR became part of the  London and North Eastern Railway  (LNER) who continued to serve the line. Burnbank saw trains going to and from  Hamilton . The LNER was nationalized under the  Transport Act 1947  and became part of  British Railways  who also continued to serve the line until 1952.

Just north of the station there was a spur to Burnbank goods depot.

The station was again closed on 15 September 1952. [2]

No trace of Burnbank station remains. The remains of the trackbed and presumably the platforms were still visible in the 1980s, at which time the land was landscaped and houses built upon. However, while traces of the station are gone, the line's history still remains visible with old bridges still remaining in and around the area.
