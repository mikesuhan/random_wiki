The  Iglesia de San Lucas  is located on front the Bu hill at southeast of the city of  Toledo , in  Castile-La Mancha ,  Spain  nailed in a walled enclosure that was an old cemetery, where it is said that the last  Mozarabes  of the city were buried.

Built in the 7th century [1]  under Mudéjar influence, it was rebuilt in Mozarabic style in the 12th century, in the 16th century it was added the Baroque chapel of the Virgin Virgen de Esperanza.

It is cited in a poem attributed to  Saint Ildefonsus , where it is said that it was erected in 641 by Evancio, Nicholas' son, who married Blesila and who were the Saint Ildefonsus' grandfathers. [2]  This fact can not be confirmed and could even be a mosque adapted as a Christian church, due to the irregular layout of the south wall and the consequent asymmetry of the immediate nave of the epistle.

The Iglesia de San Lucas of Toledo was one of the Mozarabic churches of Toledo that had the privilege to maintain this rite after the Reconquista.
