Wellington West  was a parliamentary  electorate  in the western suburbs of  Wellington , New Zealand, from 1938 to 1946. It was represented by two  Members of Parliament , including  Catherine Stewart , the country's second female MP. It was succeeded by the  Karori electorate .

The 1931  census  had been cancelled due to the  Great Depression , so the 1937 electoral redistribution had to take ten years of population growth into account. The increasing population imbalance between the  North  and  South Islands  had slowed, and only one electorate seat was transferred from south to north. Five electorates were abolished, one former electorate ( Onehunga ) was re-established, and four electorates were created for the first time, including Wellington West. [1]

By area, the Wellington West electorate was mostly made up from what previously belonged to the  Otaki  electorate. By population, it mostly gained areas from the  Wellington Suburbs  electorate. [2]  Settlements within the electorate's area were  Makara  and  Makara Beach . [3]

Wellington West existed from the  1938 election  for two parliamentary terms until 1946. [4]

Catherine Stewart  was the first representative. She won the election in 1938, when she defeated long-standing MP  Robert Alexander Wright  who had previously represented the Wellington Suburbs electorate. [5] [6]  Stewart was the second woman to be elected to Parliament after  Elizabeth McCombs . [7]  She was defeated in the next ( 1943 election ) by  Charles Bowden . [8]  At the end of the term in 1946, the electorate was abolished, and Bowden moved to  Karori . [9]
