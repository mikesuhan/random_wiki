The  2000   San Francisco 49ers  season  was the team's 51st year with the  National Football League .  Jerry Rice  entered the 2000 season as the oldest player in the league at the wide receiver position. [1]  However, with the emergence of  Terrell Owens , Rice decided to leave the team after 16 seasons.

The 49ers improved from 4-12 in 1999 to 6-10, but still suffered back-to-back losing seasons for the first time since four consecutive losing seasons from 1977-80.

Without  Steve Young , who retired after the 1999 season, the 49ers fully relied on second-year quarterback Jeff Garcia, who enjoyed his best season, and being named to the Pro Bowl after this season.
