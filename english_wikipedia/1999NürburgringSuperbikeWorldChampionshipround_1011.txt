The  1999 Nürburgring Superbike World Championship round  was the 6th round of the  1999 Superbike World Championship season . It took place on the weekend of 11–13 June 1999 at the  Nürburgring . It was highly criticised by the riders after track officials failed to show race flags.  Carl Fogarty  and  Troy Corser  won Race 1 and Race 2 respectively.

During Race 1,  Igor Jerman 's Kawasaki dumped oil at the Castrol Curve, causing multiple other riders to crash, including  Noriyuki Haga ,  Akira Yanagawa ,  Pierfrancesco Chili  and  Colin Edwards , due to marshals failing to show Oil Flags. The marshals also failed to show Blue Flags and as a result Fogarty collided with back-marker  Lothar Kraus , knocking Kraus off his bike and out of the race. Kraus blamed the flag marshals for the incident, as could be seen from his gesticulations immediately after the crash.

When Edwards went down, he was livid and showed his anger by throwing gravel on the track and showing his middle finger multiple times. After the race Edwards stated "I'm not coming back to this f***ing country ever again", that he didn't care about the second race and that he wanted to go home and play some  golf .
