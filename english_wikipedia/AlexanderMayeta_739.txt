Alexander Mayeta Kerr  (born February 22, 1977 in  Playa ,  Havana , Cuba [1] ) is a  first baseman  with  Industriales  of the  Cuban National Series . He was the  play-off most valuable player  in the National Series for the  2005–06 season . [2]

Industriales won their 11th title in 2005–06, and Mayeta put up solid numbers for the team, though there were many other players with comparable statistics in the National Series. Mayeta  hit  a respectable .315, and his 15  home runs  and 71  RBIs  led the team (tied for 11th and 13th in the league, respectively). However, he was seventh on the team in doubles, and his .555  slugging percentage  was far off the league-leading pace set by  Michel Enríquez  of  Isla de la Juventud  (.690).

The following is a comparison of Mayeta's numbers with the last two MVP award winners, Yulieski Gourriel and Osmani Urrutia, and two other stars of the league. [3] [4]  Leaders are shown in  bold .
