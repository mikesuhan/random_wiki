Trini Lopez at PJ's  is the debut, live album by singer and guitarist  Trini Lopez , released in 1963 on  Reprise Records . [1] [2]  Many of the tracks are folk music songs. The record was a result of  Don Costa  hearing him perform at  PJ's  nightclub, and signing him to his new Reprise record label. The club floor was miked to get the crowd reaction on the record, as the producer and  Sinatra  wanted the "live" experience to come across in the recording. The cover shows Lopez with his  Barney Kessel  guitar, outside the nightclub.

The album includes a  cover  of " If I Had a Hammer ", which reached  number one  in 36 countries (No. 3 in the United States). It sold over one million copies, [3]  and was awarded a  gold disc . [4]  Lopez also performs a version of the traditional  Mexican song  " La Bamba ". This version was later re-issued as a single in 1966.
