The  Rokkaku clan   ( 六角氏 ,   Rokkaku-shi )  was a  Japanese  samurai clan [1]

Founded by Sasaki Yasutsuna of  Ōmi Province  in the 13th century, the name Rokkaku was taken from their residence within Kyoto; however, many members of this family continued to be called  Sasaki . Over the course of the Muromachi period, members of the clan held the high post of Constable ( shugo ) of various  provinces .

During the  Ōnin War  (1467–77), which marked the beginning of the  Sengoku period , the clan's  Kannonji Castle  came under assault. As a consequence of defeat in the field, the clan entered a period of decline.

Like other hard-pressed  daimyōs , the Rokakku tried to enhance their military position by giving closer attention to improved civil administration within their domain. For instance, in 1549, the Rokkaku eliminated a paper merchant's guild in Mino under penalty of confiscation. Then they declared a free market in its place. [2]

The Rokakku were defeated by  Oda Nobunaga  in 1568 on his march to Kyoto and in 1570 they were absolutely defeated by  Shibata Katsuie . During the  Edo period ,  Rokkaku Yoshisuke 's descendants were considered a  kōke  clan. [1]

During the Sengoku period, Japan's social and legal culture evolved in ways unrelated to the well-known history of serial battles and armed skirmishes. A number of forward-looking daimyos independently promulgated codes of conduct to be applied within a specific han or domain. Few examples of these daimyo-made law codes have survived, but the legal framework contrived by the Rokkaku clan remains amongst the small number of documents which can still be studied:
