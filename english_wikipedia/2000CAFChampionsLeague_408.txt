The  CAF Champions League  2000  was won by  Hearts of Oak  over  Espérance .

1 AS de Vacoas-Phoenix  were ejected from the competition for fielding an ineligible player.

1   APR FC  withdrew after the first leg; they were banned from CAF competitions for three years and fined $4000. 
 2   Black Africa  withdrew.

1 The match was interrupted for 18 minutes at 75' with  Espérance de Tunis  leading 1–0 after teargas was fired into a rioting crowd by police, with one canister landing in the VIP box. Espérance de Tunis  protested against the result, but the protest was rejected. It was also marred by the antics of the Esperance goalkeeper El Ouer Chokri who deliberately injured himself with the intent to get the game abandoned since Esperance had exhausted their substitution. He was banned for one year by CAF for gamesmanship after the game.
