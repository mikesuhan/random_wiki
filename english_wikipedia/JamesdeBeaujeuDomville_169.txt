James de Beaujeu Domville  (23 June 1933 [1]  – April 2, 2015) was a  French -born  Canadian   theatrical producer  and administrator. In addition to his theatrical work, Domville served in several important Canadian cultural positions, including five years as Commissioner of the  National Film Board of Canada  (NFB).

Domville was born in  Cannes [1]  on the  French Riviera  to a Canadian father and an American mother. He was a great-grandson of Canadian politician  James Domville  on his father's side and a grandson of novelist  Edgar Saltus  through his mother. [2] [3]  He attended  Selwyn House School  and  Trinity College School [3]  and studied at the  University of Fribourg  in  Switzerland  and then at  McGill University  in  Montreal , Quebec, Canada, from which he gained a  Bachelor of Civil Law  degree. [2]

His first theatre work was the production of the satirical  musical   My Fur Lady . [4]  He was co-writer and producer of  My Fur Lady , [2]  which was a success, being produced at the  Stratford Festival  and then touring Canada from 1957 to 1958. [4]  Following on from this, Domville co-founded a theatre production company, Quince Productions. [4]  He co-produced  Jubilee  and  Spring Thaw  over the following few years, and was also involved in theatre design, helping to plan the  Fredericton Playhouse  and the  National Theatre School of Canada . [4]

From 1964 until 1968, he served as the National Theatre School's Director-General. [2]  He was then the Executive Director of the  Théâtre du Nouveau Monde  from 1968 until 1972. [2]  He also sat on the Advisory Arts Panel of the  Canada Council  from 1968 until 1972, serving as the panel's chairman for the final three of those years. [4]

It was in 1972 that he first became involved with the National Film Board, being appointed its Assistant Director of English Production. [2]  He became Executive Producer in charge of the NFB's  drama film  output in 1974, and then in September 1975 was appointed Assistant Film Commissioner by  André Lamy . [2]  In his time at the NFB he pursued his enthusiasm for  underwater diving  by  directing  two films about the subject,  Sub-Igloo  and  Arctic IV , and co-producing an evening of programming on the theme for the  Canadian Broadcasting Corporation , which included a live transmission from the bottom of  Resolute Bay . [2]  In 1977, he was awarded the  Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal . [4]

In January 1979, Domville succeeded Lamy as Government Film Commissioner and Chair of the NFB. [5]  He later claimed that this was the only job he had ever really wanted. [6]  He faced a time of cutbacks and austerity at the NFB, but received praise for changing NFB policy in supporting the  Canadian film industry  by allowing private companies, rather than the NFB, to undertake the majority of  sponsored film  production. [7]  It was also during Domville's time in charge of the NFB that its Studio D unit produced the controversial documentary features  Not a Love Story  (1981) and  If You Love This Planet  (1982). [8]  Following disagreements with the government, and despite feeling that it had been the most interesting phase of his career, [6]  Domville left his role at the NFB in January 1984. [7]

He died of melanoma in Singapore on April 2, 2015, at the age of 81. [3]
