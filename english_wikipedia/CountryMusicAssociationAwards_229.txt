The  Country Music Association  Awards , also known as the  CMA Awards  or  CMAs , are presented to  country music  artists and broadcasters to recognize outstanding achievement in the country music industry. [1] [2]  The televised annual presentation ceremony features performances and award presentations by popular country music artists. [1]

The first CMA awards were presented at an untelevised ceremony at the  Nashville Municipal Auditorium  in 1967; the Entertainer of the Year award that night went to  Eddy Arnold . The second annual CMA awards were presented in October 1968;  NBC  taped the ceremony and televised it a few weeks later. Since then, the awards have been televised live, usually in October or November, by  NBC  from 1969 through 1971, by  CBS  from 1972 through 2005, and by  ABC  beginning in 2006. Starting in 1968 they were held at  Nashville 's  Grand Ole Opry  (initially at  Ryman Auditorium , and from 1974 through 2004 at the new  Grand Ole Opry House ). In 2005, the awards show was held at  Madison Square Garden  in  New York City . Since 2006, they have been held at Nashville's  Bridgestone Arena .

Albums and songs released between July 1 of the previous calendar year and June 30 of the award show's year are eligible for consideration. [3]  More than 7,300 individuals from the Country Music Association trade group vote for the nominees and winners through three rounds of balloting. [3]

Annual awards are given in the following twelve categories: Entertainer, Male Vocalist, Female Vocalist, New Artist (previously known as the Horizon Award until 2008), Vocal Group, Vocal Duo (introduced in 1970), Single, Album, Song, Musical Event (split off from the Vocal Duo award in 1988 as Vocal Event), Music Video (introduced in 1985), and Musician. [1]  The distinction between the Duo and Event awards is that the former is presented to two artists who normally perform together, while the latter was specifically created to honor one-off collaborations. Nine awards are also given to radio broadcasters for Station of the Year and Personality of the Year (divided into four categories each, based on market size), as well as National Personality of the Year to the host of a nationally syndicated show. [1]  Since 2012, the ceremony features a  Lifetime Achievement Award . [4]

Brad Paisley  and  Carrie Underwood  have co-hosted the ceremonies together since 2008.  Vince Gill  has been the longest consecutive host from 1992 to 2003, co-hosting with  Reba McEntire  in 1992 and  Clint Black  in 1993. The first ceremony in 1967 was co-hosted by  Sonny James  and  Bobbie Gentry , but that ceremony was not televised.
