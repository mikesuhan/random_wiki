Wat Phrachao Ong Dam  ( Thai :  วัดพระเจ้าองค์ดำ ; "Temple of the Black-Bodied Lord") is a ruined temple that is part of the  Wiang Kum Kam  archaeological site.

The ruin is named after a burnt bronze Buddha image that was discovered there.

It is located very close to the north-western side of  Wat Phaya Mangrai , another ruin in the area.
