The  ANEC IV Missel Thrush  was a 1920s  British  two-seat light aircraft built by  Air Navigation and Engineering Company Limited  at  Addlestone   Surrey .

The ANEC IV biplane was designed by John Bewsher for the  1926 Lympne light aircraft trial  for two seaters fitted with engines of less than 170Â lb. It did not make the competition as the undercarriage collapsed in a taxiing accident. In 1927 the only aircraft built (registered G-EBPI) was sold to a private owner who replaced the original  Blackburne Thrush  radial engine with an  Armstrong Siddeley Genet II  engine. The owner was killed and the aircraft destroyed while competing in the 1928 King's Cup Race.
