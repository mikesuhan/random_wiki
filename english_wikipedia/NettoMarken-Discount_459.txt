Netto Marken-Discount  is a German supermarket chain. It is owned by the largest German supermarket cooperative  Edeka Group  and operates mostly in the south and west of Germany. The first store was opened in 1984 and the chain is expanding aggressively, with its 1000th store opening in 2004 and its 4000th in 2009.

In 2009 the Edeka Group completed acquisition of the  Plus  supermarket chain and has converted the Plus supermarket locations into Netto supermarkets.

The Netto Marken-Discount retail concept is to offer well-known brands at low prices, which contrasts with the strategy of competitors  Aldi  and  Lidl  who mainly offer products badged under brand names they have created.

The chain is unrelated to the Danish  Netto  chain, which has operations in several German states, or the French-owned  Netto  discount store. However  Edeka  owns 25% of a joint venture with the Danish Netto. [1]
