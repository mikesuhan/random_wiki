Magdalena "Lena" Neuner  (since her 2014 marriage legally  Magdalena Holzer , born 9 February 1987) is a retired  German  professional  biathlete . She is the  most successful woman of all time  at  Biathlon World Championships  and a two-time Olympic gold medalist. At the age of 21, she became the youngest Overall World Cup winner in the history of the  International Biathlon Union  (IBU). With 34 World Cup wins, Neuner is ranked second all-time for career victories on the  Biathlon World Cup  tour. She has won the Overall World Cup title three times, in  2007–08 , in  2009–10  and her final season in  2011–12 . Neuner retired from the sport in March 2012, citing a lack of motivation and her desire for a normal life.

Neuner started biathlon when she was nine years old and won five junior world championship titles from 2004 to 2006. She made her World Cup debut in 2006 and won her first World Cup race in January 2007. One month later, she claimed three gold medals in her  first appearance  at the Biathlon World Championships. In the  2007–08 season , Neuner won the Overall World Cup and once more claimed three titles at the  2008 World Championships . After a less successful winter in  2008–09 , she participated in her first  Winter Olympic Games  in 2010, winning the gold medal in both the  pursuit  and the  mass start , and silver in the  sprint race . Neuner also claimed the  2009–10 Overall World Cup  title. At the  2011 World Championships , she won three more gold medals. In her final winter on the World Cup tour, Neuner won two more titles at the  2012 World Championships  and claimed the Overall World Cup for a third time.

During her seven World Cup seasons, Neuner won 34 World Cup races and achieved 63 podium finishes. As part of Germany's World Cup team, she won ten relay races and three mixed relay events. During six appearances at Biathlon World Championships, Neuner claimed 17 medals: twelve gold, four silver and one bronze. In addition, she has won seven junior world championship titles. Neuner was known as one of the fastest  cross-country skiers  in biathlon. She had been noted for her volatile shooting performances in the standing position, particularly in the early years of her career, often at the expense of better results.

Neuner has lived in the  Bavarian  village of  Wallgau  since birth. At the age of 16, she joined the  German Customs Administration  to become a member of the government-funded Customs-Ski-Team. Since winning three world championship gold medals in 2007, Neuner is one of her home country's most popular female athletes. She was named  German Sportswoman of the Year  in 2007, 2011 and 2012.

Magdalena Neuner was born in the German alpine resort town of  Garmisch-Partenkirchen , the second of four children of bank clerk Paul Neuner and his wife Margit. [2]  She has an elder brother Paul, and two younger siblings—her brother Christoph and her sister Anna. Her sister is also an aspiring biathlete who participates in junior competitions and is a member in the youth squad of the Bavarian Ski Association. [3]

Neuner grew up in the small  Bavarian  village of  Wallgau , approximately 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) from Garmisch-Partenkirchen. [4]  She started  alpine skiing  when she was four years old and later tried various other winter sports at her hometown ski club SC Wallgau. [2]  At the age of 16, Neuner finished high school ( Realschule ) in Garmisch-Partenkirchen and decided to pursue a career in biathlon. Her parents were reluctant, but they eventually supported her ambition to become a professional biathlete. [5]

Neuner started biathlon when she was nine years old after she had participated in a try out course at her local ski club. [6]  She won 29 races at the biathlon Student's Cup of the  German Ski Association  (DSV), [3]  claiming the overall title in her respective age-group for four years in a row from 1999 to 2002. [2]  After finishing school, Neuner joined the  German Customs Administration  in August 2003 to become a member in the government-supported Customs-Ski-Team ( Zoll-Ski-Team ). She officially holds the rank of  Erste Zollhauptwachtmeisterin  (first head customs officer), [7]  although she is a full-time professional athlete with no customs obligations. One of her team mates is alpine skiing world champion  Maria Höfl-Riesch . [8]

In December 2003, Neuner won the German Cup for 17-year-olds, which led to her appointment for the 2003–04 European Cup competition for juniors. [4]  With four wins at European level, Neuner qualified for the 2004 Junior/Youth World Championships in  Haute Maurienne , France, where she won the sprint and relay events, as well as silver in the pursuit. [4]  One year later at the  2005 Junior/Youth World Championships  in  Kontiolahti , Finland, she claimed two silver medals (pursuit and relay), and again won the sprint discipline. [1]  With her success at junior level, Neuner at 18 years old, was considered one of Germany's biggest biathlon talents ever. Even before achieving any results at senior level, she had signed a sponsorship deal. [9]

During the  2005–06 season , Neuner made her first appearances in the  Biathlon World Cup . Germany's women's national coach Uwe Müßiggang had already considered her for the team two years earlier, however, her parents and her hometown coaches Bernhard Kröll and Herbert Mayer were reluctant to let her start prematurely. [2]  On 13 January 2006, Neuner made her debut in the World Cup sprint race in  Ruhpolding , Germany, where she substituted for the injured  Uschi Disl . Although her first appearance ended unsuccessfully, coming in 41st place, [10]  she was appointed for nine more World Cup races for the remainder of the season. [1]

Neuner returned as one of the favourites at the 2006 Junior/Youth World Championships in  Presque Isle, Maine , United States, where she won two more titles (pursuit and relay) in addition to a silver medal in the sprint race. [1]  She did not participate in the  2006 Winter Olympics  for the German team. At the World Cup in Kontiolahti in March 2006, Neuner achieved her first top ten finishes: she was fourth in the sprint and came in ninth in the mass start race. [11] [12]

While she had only competed in ten races during her first World Cup winter, Neuner became a fixture in the German team in the  2006–07 season . [4]  She proved to be one of the fastest  cross-country skiers  in biathlon, and at 19 years old, regularly set the fastest course times. [13] [note a]  On 5 January 2007, Neuner won her first World Cup event, the sprint race in  Oberhof , Germany. [14]  Her victory on home soil, before a crowd of 19,000 people, received considerable media attention and put her into the national spotlight for the first time. [15]  Two days later at the pursuit race, she forgot to reload her rifle after warm-up. She was handed a new magazine during the prone shooting and managed to finish third despite a total of six  shooting errors . [16]

Neuner was scheduled to compete at the junior world championships in 2007. However, following her first World Cup win, she was instead appointed for the senior  World Championships  in  Antholz , Italy. [4]  On 3 February 2007, she won gold in the sprint, beating  Sweden 's  Anna Carin Olofsson  by 2.3 seconds. [17]  It was her first world championship event ever and only her second victory at senior level. [note b]  One day later, she also claimed the pursuit title, in spite of four shooting errors. [18]  Following a 14th place in the mass start, Neuner, alongside  Martina Beck ,  Andrea Henkel  and  Kati Wilhelm , also won gold in the relay race on 11 February 2007. [19]  With three titles, she was the championship's most successful athlete and became the youngest triple world champion. [6]

At the end of the season, she continued her successful run with four more World Cup wins. In March 2007, Neuner won the pursuit and mass start races at  Holmenkollen  in Oslo, Norway, [20] [21]  and she won the sprint and pursuit events at the season final in  Khanty-Mansiysk , Russia, [22] [23]  giving her seven career World Cup wins. She ended her first complete season fourth in the Overall World Cup standings and finished second in the pursuit discipline. [1]  In the course of three months, Neuner had emerged from anonymity to become one of Germany's most popular female athletes. At the end of 2007, she had earned an estimated 1.3 million euros through sponsorship and endorsement deals. [24]

After missing the podium at the  2007–08 season 's first two World Cups, Neuner was part of Germany's winning relay team in  Pokljuka , Slovenia in December 2007. [25]  She claimed her eighth World Cup win at the mass start in Oberhof in January 2008, [26]  and later that month won the relay race in Ruhpolding with the German team. [27]  Shortly before her 21st birthday, Neuner decided to again compete at the Junior/Youth World Championships, held in Ruhpolding in January 2008—the last time she was eligible to enter. [28]  She won gold in the sprint and the pursuit, but withdrew from the individual race to prepare for the senior world championships alongside her German team mates. [1]

Leading up to the  2008 World Championships  in  Östersund , Sweden, Neuner tried to lower expectations, stating a repeat of last year's performance would be impossible. [29]  She failed to defend her titles in the sprint and pursuit races, with shooting errors preventing better results; she finished 17th and sixth respectively. [1]  On 12 February 2008, she won the mixed relay with  Sabrina Buchholz ,  Andreas Birnbacher  and  Michael Greis  to claim her first gold medal. [30]  Four days later, she won her second title in the mass start, beating Norway's  Tora Berger  by 3.0 seconds. [31]  She had four shooting errors compared to Berger's one and skied side by side with the Norwegian for most of the last lap, in what she later described as her hardest fought victory ever. [32]  Alongside Martina Beck, Andrea Henkel and Kati Wilhelm, Neuner also claimed gold in the relay race on 17 February 2008. [33]  By winning three more titles, she became the youngest six-time world champion, solidifying her status as Germany's biggest biathlon star. [34]

In the following World Cups, she won the sprint races in  Pyeongchang , South Korea, and in Khanty-Mansiysk—her tenth and eleventh World Cup victories. [35] [36]  With a second-place finish in the penultimate mass start race of the season, Neuner won the 2007–08 Mass start World Cup. [37]  At the season final in Oslo, she also claimed the season's Sprint World Cup and took over the yellow bib of the Overall World Cup leader for the first time in her career. [38]  In the last race of the season, a ninth place in the mass start ensured Neuner the  2007–08 Overall Biathlon World Cup  victory. [39]  She was the youngest Overall World Cup winner since the  International Biathlon Union  was established in 1993. [40] [note c]

Neuner's preparation for the  2008–09 season  was affected by several illnesses. In the summer, she battled an intestinal fungus which forced her to pause training for seven weeks; [41]  she later attributed it to pressure of public expectations. [42]  In October 2008, she contracted influenza and in November, a bacterial infection caused her to miss two weeks of training. [43]  Subsequently, her ski speed saw a substantial drop at the start of the season. In the first four World Cups, Neuner only achieved two individual podiums; atypically courtesy of good shooting performances, not her skiing. [44] [45]

Following the Christmas break, her skiing times had improved. In Ruhpolding in January 2009, Neuner was part of the winning German relay team. [46]  She beat team mate Kati Wilhelm by 0.2 seconds in the Ruhpolding sprint and also won the following pursuit event, which marked her World Cup wins twelve and thirteen. [47] [48]  Neuner again missed the podium in Antholz. She was leading the mass start by 53.6 seconds before the final shooting, in which she missed all five targets, eventually finishing sixth. [49]  This result received much public attention. She later described it as a pivotal moment in her career and called it the "total end of the world". [50]

Neuner suffered further setbacks at the  2009 World Championships  in Pyeongchang, where she struggled with a cold and a high number of shooting errors. [51]  She finished eighth in the sprint, in which she crashed on a downhill slope, [52]  and came in eleventh in the pursuit race. [53]  She was not appointed for the individual race and could not start in the mixed relay due to her cold. On 21 February 2009, Neuner claimed silver as part Germany's women's relay team, alongside Martina Beck, Andrea Henkel and Kati Wilhelm. [54]  On the last day of the championships, she came in seventh in the mass start race. [55]

At the Olympic rehearsal in  Vancouver , Canada, in March 2009, Neuner claimed the 2008–09 Individual World Cup, despite never having won a race in that discipline. [56]  She also won the Vancouver relay race with the German team, [57]  and was second in the sprint, 0.7 seconds behind Sweden's  Helena Ekholm . [58]  At the season final in Khanty-Mansiysk, Neuner won the pursuit race—her 14th World Cup win. [59]  She ended the season fourth in the Overall Biathlon World Cup, [1]  which was generally considered disappointing in the media. [6]

Neuner later revealed that due to public expectations and constant media attention, the 2008–09 season had been extremely difficult for her psychologically, and she even briefly contemplated retirement. [60]  She started working with a psychologist and cut down her media appearances as much as possible in the summer. [61]

Neuner competed at the Summer Biathlon World Championships for the first time in September 2009 when they were held in Oberhof. She only reluctantly agreed to interrupt training and participate in the summer event, which is contested on  roller ski , however she went on to win gold in all three competitions (sprint, pursuit and mixed relay). [62]  Neuner missed the first World Cup of the  2009–10 season  due to a cold in December 2009. She returned at the following races in Hochfilzen, but was still affected by her cold and finished outside the top 20. Her first podiums of the winter came in Pokljuka, finishing third in the sprint and second in the pursuit race. [63] [64]  Thereby she secured her Olympic qualification within the German team. [65]

Shortly before the Oberhof sprint in January 2010, Neuner injured her back during warm-up and had to withdraw. [66]  She returned in Ruhpolding where she came in third in both the sprint and the mass start race. [67] [68]  In her first relay of the season, she dealt a blow to the German team by incurring two penalty loops, with Germany finishing fourth eventually. [69]  With some top competitors missing in Antholz at the last World Cup before the  2010 Winter Olympics , Neuner won two events—the first individual race of her career as well as the sprint, giving her 16 career World Cup wins. [70] [71]  She also came in second in the pursuit, which marked her seventh consecutive podium finish. [72]

Neuner went into her first Winter Olympics in Vancouver with the declared aim of winning a gold medal. On 13 February 2010, she participated in the opening  sprint , which was contested at  Whistler Olympic Park  in rainy conditions. With one shooting error, Neuner claimed the silver medal, finishing 1.5 seconds behind  Slovakia 's  Anastasiya Kuzmina . [73]  She uncharacteristically lost five seconds against the unheralded Slovak on the cross-country course, which led to speculation of inferior ski preparation in the German media. [74]  Three days later, Neuner won gold in the subsequent  pursuit race . Despite missing two targets in the standing position, she beat sprint winner Kuzmina by 12.3 seconds. [75]  In her third Olympic event, she finished tenth in the  individual . She had three shooting mistakes and said it had been difficult for her to immediately get her concentration back after winning her first gold medal. On 21 February 2010, Neuner claimed her second gold of the Games in the  mass start . After missing two targets, she had been trailing by as much as 29 seconds, but she pushed the pace and a clean final standing shoot allowed her to overtake Russia's  Olga Zaitseva  on the last lap. [76]  After the race, Neuner made the announcement not to participate in the  relay , citing mental exhaustion and her desire to give all of her team mates the chance to win a medal. Her withdrawal allowed her friend  Martina Beck  a start in her last Olympic Games. [77]  Neuner was Germany's most successful athlete in Vancouver and was chosen to carry the  German flag  at the  closing ceremony . [78]

Following her Olympic success, Neuner continued her good form at the season's remaining three World Cups, finishing all races in the top ten. She came in second in the Kontiolahti pursuit, [79]  and third in Oslo's mass start race, [80]  which increased her World Cup lead after taking over the yellow bib in Vancouver. Neuner ended the season with her 19th World Cup win in Khanty-Mansiysk's mass start, [81]  which ensured her the  2009–10 Overall World Cup , making her the first German woman to win the  Biathlon World Cup  for a second time. She also won the pursuit and mass start discipline World Cups. In the last event of the winter, the  Mixed Relay World Championship , she won gold, alongside  Simone Hauswald ,  Simon Schempp  and  Arnd Peiffer , to claim her seventh world title. [82]

During the summer, Neuner admitted struggling for motivation for the upcoming season, having won every title in the sport at only 23 years old. However, she vowed to continue her career at least until the 2012 world championships in Ruhpolding. [83]  In December 2010 she suffered from a cold, missing the season's first World Cup in Östersund for the second year in a row. She started the  2010–11 season  in Hochfilzen, where she managed two seventh-place finishes, and was part of the winning German relay team. At the third stop of the season in Pokljuka, she won the sprint race in spite of two shooting errors, claiming her 20th career victory. [84]

Neuner continued the winter with mixed results in January 2011. She reached the podium in the sprints of Oberhof and Ruhpolding, coming in second and third respectively. [85] [86]  In the relay in Oberhof, Neuner was part of Germany's team coming in sixth place, the team's worst result since 2005. [87]  She also had her worst personal result in 13 months, finishing in 16th place in the Ruhpolding individual race, which ended her streak of 24 consecutive top ten finishes (including 15 podiums and 6 wins). [88]  At the World Cup in Antholz, Neuner again struggled with illness. She only participated in the concluding mass start, coming in 6th place. [89]

At the World Cup stops in February in the United States, Neuner returned to good health and showed more consistency; her worst result was a 6th-place finish. In  Presque Isle, Maine , she won the mixed relay as part of the German team. [90]  On week later in  Fort Kent, Maine , Neuner finished all three races on the podium. She came in third in the sprint, [91]  second in the pursuit, [92]  and claimed her 21st World Cup win in the mass start—the last race before the world championships. [93]

At the  2011 World Championships  in Khanty-Mansiysk, Neuner won three gold and two silver medals. She claimed silver, alongside Andrea Henkel, Arnd Peiffer and Michael Greis, in the opening  mixed relay . On 5 March 2011, Neuner won the  sprint race  courtesy of a clean shooting performance. [94]  She finished second in the  pursuit  and fifth in the  individual  subsequently. On 12 March 2011, Neuner won her second title in the  mass start  despite of four shooing errors. [95]  The following day she also claimed gold in the  women's relay , together with Andrea Henkel,  Miriam Gössner  and  Tina Bachmann . Running the last leg for Germany, Neuner started in fourth, 67.5 seconds off the lead, but she pulled back the entire time and moved in front on the last lap. [96]  Her five medals made her the most successful female athlete in the history of  Biathlon World Championships . [97]

The season ended in disappointment for Neuner in Oslo. After claiming her 24th career win in the sprint, she had moved into second place in the Overall World Cup ranking. [98]  However, she again suffered from a cold and had to pull out of the penultimate race of the winter, the pursuit in which she would have started 31 seconds in front. This effectively ended her hopes of retaining the World Cup crown. She eventually finished fifth in the overall standings, having missed five of the season's 26 races. [1]

Before the start of the  2011–12 season , Neuner hinted the upcoming season might be her last. She began the winter in Östersund with the best season start of her career, beating Tora Berger by 0.2 seconds in the sprint to claim her 25th World Cup win. [99]  She also came third in the individual and the pursuit, and took the yellow bib of the Overall World Cup leader. On 6 December 2011, Neuner announced her retirement from biathlon by the end of the season on her homepage. She explained her early departure from the sport (at age 25) with a lack of motivation and her desire for a normal life. [100] [101] [102]  Neuner nonetheless continued her good form in Hochfilzen, where she claimed her 26th World Cup win in the sprint.

After Christmas, Neuner won both individual races in Oberhof – her World Cup wins 27 and 28. [103] [104]  In the women’s relay, she incurred 4 penalties in the final shooting, which foiled a likely German victory. [105]  Neuner suffered one of the biggest mishaps of her career, when she fired on the wrong targets in the Nove Mesto pursuit, dropping from first to seventh place. [106]  She recovered quickly by winning the sprint race in Antholz one week later. In February, Neuner claimed a double sprint and pursuit victory in Oslo despite suffering from a cold, which forced her to withdraw from the mass start. At the last World Cup stop before the world championships in Kontiolahti, she reached her sixth sprint win of the season, and extended her World Cup lead over  Darya Domracheva .

At the  2012 World Championships  in Ruhpolding, Neuner won bronze in the opening  mixed relay , alongside Andrea Henkel, Andreas Birnbacher and Arnd Peiffer. On 3 March 2012, she claimed her 11th world title in the  sprint race  courtesy of her clean shooting. Neuner dropped to second place one day later in the  pursuit , in which Domracheva overtook her at the final shooting bout. During the second week of the championships, Neuner often struggled with her shooting. She only reached 23rd place in the  individual  – her worst world championships result ever. With Tina Bachmann, Miriam Gössner and Andrea Henkel she won her second gold medal in Ruhpolding in the  women's relay  on 10 March 2012, despite incurring a penalty loop. In the concluding  mass start , Neuner came in tenth place, with six shooting mistakes in total. Her 12th gold medal made her the  second most successful biathlete of all time at world championships , behind male record holder  Ole Einar Bjørndalen .

Having led the standings uninterruptedly since the second race of the winter, Neuner won her third Overall World Cup title at the season final in Russia, where she claimed her 34th and final World Cup win in the sprint. Neuner also won the 2011–12 Sprint World Cup thanks to an unprecedented eight out of ten sprint wins. With ten victories in total, her final World Cup season was the most successful in her career. She also became only the second woman after  Magdalena Forsberg  to win the overall title more than twice. On 18 March 2012, Neuner ended her biathlon career with a sixth place in the Khanty-Mansiysk mass start.

Neuner was one of the fastest female  cross-country skiers  in biathlon. [6] [107]  During 66 of her 151 World Cup races (44%), she has set the fastest course time (race time without time spent at the shooting range or in the penalty loop). [note a]  In addition, she has been among the top three fastest skiers in 77% of her career races. [1]

In her first World Cup races in the  2005–06 season , Neuner achieved average course times; her best result was being fourth fastest in the pursuit race in Kontiolahti. [108]  During her first full season in  2006–07 , she finished among the top three fastest skiers in 19 of her 24 races and came in fastest in seven of them. Neuner won the  2007–08 Biathlon World Cup  with dominating skiing performances. She set the fastest course time in 19 of her 25 races and was second or third fastest in the remaining six. At the beginning of the  2008–09 season , Neuner had a substantial drop in her skiing times due to a series of illnesses. However, she recovered and set the fastest course time in 14 of the remaining 18 races from January onwards. In the  2009–10 Olympic season , Neuner again started slowly in December, but came back finishing among the top three fastest skiers in 17 of her 21 races. She had her second best winter in  2010–11  when she set the fastest or second fastest skiing time in 90% of her 21 races. [1]

Neuner had been a fast cross-country skier from an early age. When she was eight years old, she won the first cross-country skiing competition she entered at her local ski club. At junior level, her lap times at the German Student's Cup were comparable to older or male opponents. [2]  At the age of 15, Neuner managed to set the same skiing times as her coeval male training partners. In preparation for the 2006–07 season, Neuner skied 5,300 kilometres (3,300 mi) in training; she increased the volume to 6,000 kilometres (3,700 mi) for the 2007–08 season. [24]  Because of her ski speed, she has often been able to compensate for one or sometimes two or three shooting errors (a penalty loop is 150 metres (160 yd) long and normally takes 21 to 26 seconds). [109]

During three of her 32 World Cup wins ( 2007 World Championships  pursuit,  2008 World Championships  mass start, and 2009 Ruhpolding pursuit), Neuner skied three additional penalty loops compared to the second-place finisher. [18] [31] [48]  In March 2008, she came in second in the Khanty-Mansiysk mass start race, despite completing five penalty loops. [110]  She also reached third place in the Oberhof pursuit in January 2007 with six missed targets. [111]  At Neuner's first World Cup victory in the individual discipline in January 2010, she compensated for a total time penalty of two minutes on the 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) cross-country course (incurred by two additional shooting errors). [70]

Neuner averaged a career shooting accuracy of 78%. Her career average in the prone position was 88%, while her career average in the standing position was 67%. Her shooting results in the prone position were similar to other top contenders. The standing shoot had long been her weak point and her hit percentage was well below average in the World Cup field, although it had improved considerably in her later seasons. [1]

With a 78% accuracy, Neuner had solid shooting results during her  2005–06 season  debut. Her average dropped to 74% in her first complete season in  2006–07 . Neuner won the  2007–08 Biathlon World Cup  with a shooting accuracy of 73%, which is the lowest result for an Overall World Cup winner ever and roughly ten per cent below the previous three winners' averages:  Andrea Henkel  (84%), [113]   Kati Wilhelm  (87%) [114]  and  Sandrine Bailly  (81%). [115]  She steadily increased her shooting percentages in the following two seasons with a 76% average in  2008–09 , and her career best results of 82% in the  2009–10 Olympic season . In the  2010–11 season , she set her career high in the standing position with a 75% accuracy. [1]

Neuner's shooting performances have been a regular topic in the German media. At times she has been reluctant to discuss her shooting in interviews and has said the public's fixation on it contributes to the problem. [42]  She has insisted her difficulties in the standing position are not due to technical weaknesses but psychological, and her training results are just as good as the results of her team mates. [116]  She explained in interviews that she had developed a fear of the standing shooting over time, knowing she had to justify herself after the race if she missed. [117]  In 2008, Neuner trained with  Bundeswehr  shooting coach and former large calibre world champion, Rudi Krenn, and subsequently changed her stance slightly. [118]  Since 2009, she has worked with a psychologist, primarily focusing on mental techniques to build her confidence on the shooting range. [61]  Her standing position average has improved from 60% to 75% from 2008 to 2011. [1]  Neuner has been wearing ear plugs during some of the races in order to better concentrate while shooting. [24]  The individual race, which places a high emphasis on shooting, has traditionally been her worst discipline (each shooting error results in a one-minute time penalty, instead of a penalty loop). [109]

Neuner has won 6 races (all sprints) with a perfect shooting record: Khanty-Mansiysk sprint in March 2007,  2011 World Championship sprint  and 4 sprints in her  final 2011–12 season . [22]  She also shot clean on two other occasions, the sprint in Kontiolahti in March 2006, coming in fourth place, [119]  and the Östersund sprint in December 2008, finishing third. [44]  Her worst shooting performance came in December 2008, with a total of nine shooting errors at the World Cup pursuit in Hochfilzen. [120]  Neuner's costliest shooting occurred during a mass start race in Antholz in January 2009. After 15 clean shots, she was leading by 53.6 seconds before the final shooting, in which she missed all five targets, eventually dropping to sixth place. [49]

Her second gold medal win in the  Olympic mass start  was seen live by 9.75 million television viewers (a 31.5 per cent market share), the most watched programme of the Games in Germany. [129]  Her withdrawal from the  Olympic relay  was one of the dominating stories of the Winter Olympics in Germany, leading to much media speculation whether pulling out had been entirely her decision. [130]  She later received the Fair Play medal of Germany's Olympic Society for setting an example of "team spirit". [131]

Neuner won the Biathlon Award, chosen by the national coaches of the World Cup teams, for Female Athlete of the Year in both 2007 and 2008, [133]  and she was awarded the  Goldener Ski  (Golden Ski), the highest award of the  German Ski Association  in 2007, 2008 and 2010.
