The  Bayerische Verfassungsmedaille  (Bavarian Constitution Medal) is an award by the German state  Bavaria , which is awarded annually by the  Bavarian state parliament  to persons who have rendered outstanding services to the Bavarian constitution. The medal is given in Silver and Gold.

The medal was established on 1 December 1961, donated by the then president of parliament  Rudolf Hanauer  ( de ) , as the necessity arose to honour long-serving members of parliament. The inscription on the medal is "Bayerische Verfassung" (Bavarian constitution) with the Roman year figures MDCCCXVIII (1818), MCMXIX (1919) and MCMXLVI (1946), the obverse shows the  Coat of arms of Bavaria .

On 20 July 2011, the medal was elevated to the rank of an order. [1]

Many politicians received the medal, including  Franz Götz  and  Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger . Members of the Bavarian parliament receive it usually after three legislative periods (formerly 12 years, now 15 years of service), ministers typically after one term (formerly 4 years, now five years). The medal has been awarded also to artists such as ballerina  Konstanze Vernon , and clerics such as  Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger , the later pope.
