Novitates entomologicae  was a French  entomological  journal. It was published by  Eugène Le Moult  and established in 1931.

The size of the publication was very large: 25 × 33 cm, recalling something like the publications of  Émile Deyrolle .

These are mainly Le Moult himself on Lepidoptera and Coleoptera, (A.) Thierry on  Buprestidae , P. Basilewsky on  Carabidae  and  Stephan von Breuning  on  Cerambycidae . [1]

The best known works are those of  Le Moult  on the genus  Prepona  with four-colour plates and the ones of  Breuning :  Études sur les Lamiaires .

Études sur les Lamiaires  were published in two parts. The first one has 568 pages and the second 615 pages. The special interest of these monographs are the numerous illustrations: 582 and 367 figures. This has been rarely the case in the other Breunings' works.
