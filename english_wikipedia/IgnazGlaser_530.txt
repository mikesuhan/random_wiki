Ignaz Glaser  (May 5, 1853 – August 11, 1916) was an  Austrian  businessman from  Prague  and the founder of one of the biggest sheet glass factories in the  k.u.k.  monarchy.

In 1881 in  Bürmoos  near  Salzburg  he used the legal estate of a former  glassworks  company that went bankrupt four years earlier and he bought a giant  moor  area. He expanded the factory with four glass ovens, which worked with turf. He also founded a brickyard, which was very successful and which existed throughout the 1970s. Bit by bit he then bought further moor areas in the neighboring  Weidmoos  and at  Ibmer  moor, where he also started to cultivate  hops . In the middle of the Ibmer area, in  Hackenbuch ,  Upper Austria , he established another glass factory. The turf factory was very unstable because it depended on the weather a lot and the turf supplies drew to a close. Thus Glaser bought a closed sugar factory in  North Bohemian   Bruex  and established a new glass factory. In that factory ovens were heated with coal from an open pit, which made the company independent from weather conditions. After Glaser’s death in 1916, his son Dr.  Hermann Glaser,  born on August 18, 1889, took over the glass factory, which experienced a short economic boom after  World War I . But then the company missed the update to mechanical flat glass fabrication and the Glaser empire broke down in 1926. In Bürmoos, flat glass was produced by a company named Stiassny until the end of 1929, which then bought the holdings. At this point glass fabrication was shut down totally. Eighty percent of the population there was unemployed.

Glaser’s grave is in the Jewish cemetery in Salzburg–Aigen. His son survived the  Holocaust  in  Shanghai  and died on January 10, 1956 in  Vienna .

In 2006 the first  Ignaz-Glaser-Symposium  organized by  Andreas Maislinger  with a focus on  integration  took place.
