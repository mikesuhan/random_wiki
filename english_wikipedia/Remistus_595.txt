Remistus  (died in  Ravenna , September 17, 456) was a general of the  Western Roman Empire , commander-in-chief of the army under Emperor  Avitus .

Remistus was a  Visigoth , as shown by his Germanic name. In 456 Remistus reached a high military rank under Emperor  Avitus , who probably appointed him  magister militum , and received the rank of  patricius : he was the first  magister militum  since the death of  Aetius  in 454 and the first barbarian  magister militum .

The newly appointed general took up residence in  Ravenna , the capital, with a group of Goths. That same year Avitus, who was opposed by the Roman Senate, decided to leave Italy and go to his native Gaul to gather reinforcements; Remistus remained back to control Italy. He clashed with the Senate army, led by the Italian  magister militum   Ricimer  and was forced to return to Ravenna; besieged, he was captured and put to death in the Palace  in Classis , just outside the city, on September 17.

The following month, Avitus was deposed and killed.
