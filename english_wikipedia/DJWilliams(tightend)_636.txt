Although like other students Williams could have cited many accolades, he chose this statement alone to appear with his picture in the yearbook: "Baptized into Christ." Williams has cited the  Passion of the Christ  as exemplifying the way he and his mother, Vicky Williams, and his two sisters overcame his abusive father and other challenges, including on the football field. DJ was working as a co-host on the morning show at Little Rock NBC affiliate television station KARK channel 4, when he was called by the Washington Redskins to join the team during their 2015 pre-season camp. Since he was cut before the regular season began, Williams is expected to return to KARK. [1]
