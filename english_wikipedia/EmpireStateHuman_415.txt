"Empire State Human"  is a song by the British  synthpop  group  The Human League . The song was written by  Philip Oakey ,  Martyn Ware  and  Ian Craig Marsh . It was produced by  Colin Thurston , and recorded at Monumental Studios in Sheffield. [2]

The song was the third single to be released by the original line-up of the Human League, and the first and only single from the band's 1979 debut album  Reproduction . Upon its first release in October 1979, the single failed to chart. However, it was re-released in June 1980 and fared slightly better, reaching number 62 in the  UK Singles Chart . [3]  For the re-release,  Virgin Records  included a free copy of the single "Only After Dark" with the first 15,000 copies as a sweetener.

Lyrically, "Empire State Human" is a song about becoming powerful using the analogy of size, with Oakey declaring that he wants to be "tall" a total of 60 times in 3 minutes. Uncut magazine drew a comparison with Oakey's own personal ambition:

The B-side, "Introducing", is an instrumental. Oakey sang on the original recording but the vocals were not used on the released version.  [2]

It was used in the 2012 video game  Lollipop Chainsaw  in a minigame for the retro stage, and also featured on the game's original soundtrack.
