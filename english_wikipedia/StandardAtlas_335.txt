The  Standard Atlas  is a light van which was produced and sold under various names between 1958 and 1980, initially in  Britain , and subsequently in  India . [2]

In 1958  Standard  presented the Atlas, their contender in the growing but (in Britain) increasingly crowded small van sector. It was a competitor for  BMCs  venerable  J-Type  and the much more modern  Morris J2 , as well as for the  Ford Thames 400E  and the market leading  Bedford CA . For some export markets, notably Canada, the Standard Atlas was badged as a Triumph, reflecting the value of the brand recognition achieved for the Triumph name by sports models such as the  Triumph TR3 .

Light vans in Britain were at this time frequently identified by their maximum permissible gross payload, and the Atlas was often advertised simply as the Atlas 10 cwt or the Atlas 12 cwt, reflecting allowable load weights (including a driver) of 500 kg and 600 kg. In addition to the panel van, a pick up truck version was also offered. Both hinged doors and sliding doors were offered. There was also a small flatbed truck version which had  rear hinged  doors.

Like its competitors, the Atlas shared its engine with a passenger car from its manufacturer's range. In this case the engine in question was the 948cc petrol/gasoline engine from the  Standard Ten , which was installed under a cowling between the driver and his passenger, and delivered power to the rear wheels. In this form the van was very slow. This was addressed in 1961 when it became possible to specify the van with a 1670cc petrol/gasoline. The larger dimensions of this engine meant that the chassis had to be enlarged and the cabin design rearranged. At the same time the smaller engine was enlarged to 1147cc.

When the Standard Company was blended with British Leyland in 1964/5 the Atlas vans were the badged as Leyland 15 and Leyland 20, and were now provided with the Standard 2138cc petrol/gasoline engine that also powered the  Triumph TR4 . Payload limits had also been raised to 15 cwt (750 kg gross) and 20 cwt (1000 kg gross). It was now also possible to order the van with a diesel engine. The unit in question was a 2260cc 60 hp (44 kW) unit from  Massey-Ferguson  who also installed it in tractors. [3]

In 1963  Standard  was acquired by  Leyland Motors Limited  and for 1964 the little van was renamed  Leyland 15 / Leyland 20  (according to capacity).

In 1968 Leyland merged with the  British Motor Corporation  to form the  British Leyland Motor Corporation , and the van was taken out of production in order to avoid direct competition with a range of vans such as the  Morris JU 250 , now produced by the same company.

After production of the van in the  United Kingdom  had ended, the tooling and panel presses were exported to southern  India  where the van re-emerged, to be produced, between 1970 and 1980 by  Standard Motors  of  Chennai .
