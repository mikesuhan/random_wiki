Clelandina  is an extinct genus of  rubidgeine   gorgonopsian  from the  Late Permian  of  Africa . It was first named by  Broom  in 1948. The type and only species is  C. rubidgei . It is relatively rare, with only four known specimens. [1] [2]

Clelandina rubidgei  has an extraordinarily small  sclerotic ring  relative to the size of its orbit, which implies that it was  diurnal . It is the only  rubidgeine  with a preserved sclerotic ring, so it is unknown whether this trait was shared by other members of the subfamily. Like all rubidgeines, it was relatively large, with a skull up to 36Â cm long. It had reduced dentition, with the teeth posterior to the  canines  being absent and replaced with a bony ridge. The skull has heavily pachyostosed, with massive rugose bosses. [1]

Clelandina  shares many characteristics with  Rubidgea  and  Dinogorgon , which has led some authors to synonymize them. All three are now considered to be part of the same tribe,  Rubidgeini , rather than the same genus.
