Elizabeth  is a  steam  powered ' combination bus ' that operates in the English seaside town of  Weston-super-Mare , and previously in  Whitby . [1]

The vehicle was created in 2002, when a tourism transport operator, the Northern Star Motor Carriage Company, converted a 1931  Sentinel  steam-powered DG6P flatbed  lorry  into a 30-seat bus. [1]  It is used to take people on a tour of the town, providing up to ten trips per day over the summer months. It is the only steam bus in revenue-earning service in the world and has become something of a tourist attraction in its own right. [2]  As of April 2015 it has been purchased by  Crosville , a public and heritage bus operator in Weston-super-Mare. [3]

It has two gears, chain transmission, six wheels and ten pneumatic tyres, and a body made from white ash and mahogany. [1]  It was a flatbed lorry and then a tar sprayer in its original commercial life, before being bought from a scrapyard for preservation in 1962. [4]

Before the bus could carry fare-paying passengers, it had to undergo a 35Â° tilt test and required an amendment to the Road Traffic Act since the exhaust was not sited at the rear of the vehicle. [5]  In November 2011, it took part in London's  Lord Mayor's Show . [6]  The journey from Whitby to London, via York, Leeds, Bradford, Burton upon Trent and Rugby was all by Elizabeth's own steam power.
