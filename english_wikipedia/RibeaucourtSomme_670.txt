Ribeaucourt  is a  commune  in the  Somme   department  in  Hauts-de-France  in northern  France .

Ribeaucourt is situated 15 miles (24 km) east of  Abbeville , on the D185 and D66 crossroads.

The name of the commune is a corruption of  Erembauldocurtis  (which comes from "Eremboldus" = (skilful or bold leader) and "curtis", meaning a fortified house). Eremboldus was the name of several male members of the Ribeaucourt family, vassals to the abbey of  Saint Riquier . The other communes in France bearing the same name have the same origins. 
During the  Second World War , Ribeaucourt forest was the site of launching ramps for the German  V1  rockets. The Germans also occupied the château. Allied bombardments on the 5 and 7 July 1944 caused serious damage to the village and the forest. [1]
