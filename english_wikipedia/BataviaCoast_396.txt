Batavia Coast  is a name attributed to a section of the coastline of  Western Australia , in the region close to the vicinity of the site of the wreck of the  Batavia  in the  Abrolhos Islands .

It lies north of the  Sunset Coast  and  Turquoise Coast .

In the early 1990s maps of the coast included the main place on the coast as  Geraldton , with  Kalbarri  as the northernmost location, and  Jurien  and  Cervantes  at the southern end. [1]
