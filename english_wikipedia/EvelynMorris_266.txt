Evelyn Morris , also known as  Pikelet , is a musician from the outer suburbs of  Melbourne ,  Australia . [1]  Although she'd played piano from a young age she began her career in music as a hardcore/punk obsessed drummer, performing in many bands but mostly in  Baseball [2]  and  True Radical Miracle . In 2003 she switched from drum kit to a mix of instruments and a loop pedal to start a solo career. [3]  She utilises delay pedals, piano accordion, drums, guitar and other forms of percussion in her music. [4]

The name Pikelet comes from Evelyn’s mother, who used to spoil her kids with pikelets when she was a little strapped for cash. “She always had eggs, she always had flour and powdered milk in the cupboard, so she would just throw together pikelets,” Evelyn told Mess+Noise in 2007. “It was a really big deal for me, but I found out later that it was just what she did when she had nothing else.” [5]

Pikelet released her self-titled album in 2007. [1]  She has toured throughout Australia, Europe and New Zealand playing with acts including  Frida Hyvönen , [6]   Jens Lekman , [7]   Beirut ,  Camera Obscura ,  Darren Hanlon ,  The Blow ,  Sufjan Stevens  and  Ned Collette . [ citation needed ]

'Not So Still' is the title of her 2009 EP released on Special Awards Records. She has released three albums; Pikelet (2007), Stem (2010) and Calluses (2013) on the  Chapter Music  label.

From 2010 Pikelet has come to refer to a band consisting of Morris, Shags Chamberlain, Tarquin Manek and Matthew Cox. Later releases have been described as 'deep psych pop' and songs have been written collaboratively [8]

She played at Melbourne's main Arts Festival in 2010, and was a speaker at the  2010 Melbourne live music rally .
