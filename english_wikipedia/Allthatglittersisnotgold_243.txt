All that glitters is not gold  is a well-known saying, meaning that not everything that looks precious or true turns out to be so. This can apply to people, places, or things that promise to be more than they really are. The expression, in various forms, originated in or before the 12th century [1]  and may date back to  Æsop . [2]  The Latin is  Non omne quod nitet aurum est. [3]

Chaucer  gave two early versions in English: " But al thyng which that shyneth as the gold / Nis nat gold, as that I have herd it told " in " The Canon's Yeoman's Tale ", [3]  and " Hyt is not al golde that glareth " in " The House of Fame ". [4]

The popular form of the expression is a derivative of a line in  William Shakespeare 's play  The Merchant of Venice , which employs the word "glisters," a 17th-century synonym for "glitters." The line comes from a secondary plot of the play, the puzzle of  Portia 's boxes (Act II - Scene VII - Prince of Morocco):

All that glisters is not gold—   Often have you heard that told.   Many a man his life hath sold   But my outside to behold.   Gilded tombs do worms enfold.   Had you been as wise as bold,   Young in limbs, in judgment old,   Your answer had not been inscrolled   Fare you well. Your suit is cold—   Cold, indeed, and labor lost.

Panning for gold often results in finding  pyrite , nicknamed  fool's gold , which reflects substantially more light than authentic gold does. Gold in its raw form appears dull and does not glitter. [ citation needed ]  The expression is also found in Yiddish (nit als vos glanst iz gold), especially amongst Hasidim, and also appears in a Hebrew work of Mendele Mocher Sforim.

In pop culture, this phrase shows up in  Bob Marley 's " Get Up, Stand Up ". [5] [6]  It is also used as lyrics in the song "A Guided Masquerade" by  Alesana , in the song "Domino Rain" by  Antemasque , in the song  "Gold"  by  Prince , and in the  Kanye West  song, " Family Business ".

"Not all that glitters is gold" is an alternative formulation. [7] [8] [9]

Another common formulation with the same meaning is "All that  shines  is not gold", as seen in the title and refrain of the song "All That Shines Is Not Gold" [10]  and in the lyrics of " Next Time You See Me " [11]  as well as  Curtis Mayfield 's " That's What Mama Say ". [12]

Neil Young  uses the saying in his song "Don't Be Denied" ("Well, all that glitters isn't gold, I know you've heard that story told.") from his 1973 album  Time Fades Away  to express his "realization that even success wouldn't make him happy", even after he obtained fame and money. [13]  The inverse of this expression, "All that glitters is gold," is a lyric in the  Led Zeppelin  song, " Stairway to Heaven ", the  Smash Mouth  song,  "All Star" , the  Death in Vegas  song,  "All That Glitters" , and in the  Future Islands  song "A Dream of You and Me" followed by the lyric "Don't believe what you've been told". "All that glitters is cold," is also a lyric in the song " Posthuman " by  Marilyn Manson  from the album " Mechanical Animals ".
