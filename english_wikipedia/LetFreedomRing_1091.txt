Let Freedom Ring  is an album by  jazz  saxophonist  Jackie McLean , recorded in 1962 and released on the  Blue Note  label. [2]

McLean wrote three of the four compositions. "Melody for Melonae" is dedicated to his daughter (as was an earlier composition, "Little Melonae"), and appeared as "Melanie" on  Matador , a later recording that he made with  Kenny Dorham . The slower-tempo performance on  Let Freedom Ring  is notable as being the first time that McLean used "provocative upper-register screams". [3]  "Rene" and "Omega" are both blues-related pieces, the former with a standard  twelve-bar  structure and harmonies, the latter more abstract and  modal . The one non-McLean track is  Bud Powell 's  ballad , "I'll Keep Loving You".

The  Allmusic  review by Steve Huey awarded the album 5 stars and stated: "The success of Let Freedom Ring paved the way for a bumper crop of other modernist innovators to join the Blue Note roster and, artistically, it still stands with One Step Beyond as McLean's greatest work." [4]   The Penguin Guide to Jazz  gives  Let Freedom Ring  four out of four stars, and includes the album in a selected "Core Collection". [5]
