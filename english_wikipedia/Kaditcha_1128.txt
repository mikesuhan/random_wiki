Kaditcha  was an  automobile  manufacturer in  Australia . The company, formed by Queensland engineer Barry Lock, made  open wheel  and  sports car   racing cars , including cars for  Formula 5000 ,  Formula Pacific  and  Australian Formula 2 .

The peak of Kaditcha's form was in the mid-1980s when Kaditcha sports cars dominated the  Australian Sports Car Championship . Chris Clearihan won the  1982 Championship  in a 5.0L  Chevrolet  powered version, with Kaditcha's finishing that year in 1st, 2nd and 3rd places. Clearihan finished 3rd in the  1983 Championship , which was won by Peter Hopwood driving a later model Kaditcha-Chevrolet that Lock built using a  Lola T400  Formula 5000 as its base. Hopwood moved to the  Australian Drivers' Championship  in 1984 with Clearihan taking over the 1983 title winning car and finished second in the  1984 Championship . [1]

Kadticha's most famous race car is one that no longer bears its name. The  Romano WE84  raced by Bap Romano began its racing life in 1983 as the Kaditcha K583. [2]  Romano used the WE84 (re-engineered by former  Williams  and  Tyrrell   Formula One  mechanic Wayne Eckersley) to easily win the 1984 Australian Sports Car Championship. It was Australia's first  Group A Sports Car  built with a closed top and  Ground effects   aerodynamics  like the cars, such as the  Porsche 956 , seen at the time in the  World Sportscar Championship . Bap Romano's 1984 ASSC domination was almost complete, setting Pole Position at every round, scoring fastest lap at for each race contested (Clearihan scored fastest lap in Heat 2 of Round 1), and won all bar Round 1 at  Calder Park  where Romano crashed heavily in Heat 1, damaging the car enough to ensure it was a non-starter in Heat 2. Clearihan's Kaditcha-Chev won Round 1.

Most Kaditcha sports cars were powered by either the 5.0L Chevrolet  V8 engine , or in the case of the SR781 run by Jeff Harris, the  Mazda 13B   rotary engine . The K583/WE84 was at first powered by the 3.0L  Cosworth DFV  V8, originally developed for  Formula One . Romano upgraded to the 3.9L  Cosworth DFL  in late 1984 for the  1984 Sandown 1000   World Sportscar Championship  race at  Sandown  in  Melbourne . Currently the car runs the 3.5L  Cosworth DFZ  V8, with Romano having Barry Lock rebuild the car in 2010 following its major crash at  Amaroo Park  in 1986, the crash ending the cars original racing life.

After the WE84 was destroyed at Amaroo Park in 1986, it sat in storage for a number of years, though has since been restored by Romano and Lock. While it still carries the name of the 1984 Australian Sports Car Champion, the front nose of the car has retained the moulded Kaditcha logo pointing to its original roots.

Kaditcha manufactured cars for open wheel racing, including cars for  Formula Pacific  and  Formula 2 . A Kaditcha appeared at the  1981 Australian Grand Prix  at Calder Park. Peter Larner qualifying his 1.6L  Ford  powered car 16th (only 1.5 seconds slower than pole and race winner  Roberto Moreno  in a  Ralt  RT4). Larner finished 11th, 3 laps down on Moreno. Ian Bland then drove a Kaditcha in the  1983 Australian Grand Prix , qualifying 20th (out of 24), and finishing 16th (and last), 23 laps down on race winner Moreno after a series of mechanical drama's through the race.

Sydney driver Tom Brickley leased the Cosworth BDG-powered  Formula Pacific  Kaditcha FA82A for the  1984 Australian Grand Prix  at  Calder Park Raceway . He qualified 22nd of 25 entrants. Brickley collided with eventual race winner  Roberto Moreno  on lap 75 of 100, and was spectacularly inverted. He later bought the car, converted it to  Australian Formula 2  specifications, and won the unofficial Australian Formula 2 Championship in 2000. (The  Confederation of Australian Motor Sport 's recognition of the Australian Formula 2 Championship as a national title did not extend beyond 1988.)

A Kaditcha manufactured car also won the 1990 Australian hill climb championship in the hands of Ivan Tighe using Cosworth BDG power.

Before forming Kaditcha, Lock had been a successful engineer with the  McLaren  team in  Can-Am  racing. He was later involved in the  Giocattolo  project and the Infiniti sports racing car.
