Hacking Hall  is a  Grade I listed , early-17th-century house [1]  situated at the confluence of the rivers  Calder  and  Ribble  in  Lancashire , England.

It is thought that  J. R. R. Tolkien  ( Lord of the Rings ) may have taken inspiration from the ferry here for the Bucklebury Ferry over the Brandywine river in his book, as it was still operational when Tolkien visited nearby  Stonyhurst College . [2]
