SM  U-21  or  U-XXI  was a  U-20 -class   submarine  or  U-boat  built for and operated by the  Austro-Hungarian Navy  ( German :  Kaiserliche und Königliche Kriegsmarine  or  K.u.K. Kriegsmarine ) during the  First World War . The design for  U-21  was based on submarines of the  Royal Danish Navy 's  Havmanden  class  (three of which had been built in  Austria-Hungary ), and was largely obsolete by the beginning of the war.

U-21  was just over 127 feet (39 m) long and was armed with two bow  torpedo tubes , a  deck gun , and a  machine gun . Construction on  U-21  began in mid 1915 and the boat was  launched  in September 1916. After suffering damage during a diving trial in January 1917,  U-21  underwent seven months of repairs before her  commissioning  in August 1917.

The U-boat conducted patrols off the  Albanian  coast in October 1917, but experienced the failure of the seal on her main  hatch . The repairs kept the boat out of action until June 1918. But in July a piston in her diesel engine broke, knocking the submarine out of the rest of the war. At the end of World War I,  U-21  was ceded to Italy as a  war reparation  and scrapped in 1920.  U-21  had no wartime successes.

When it became apparent to the  Austro-Hungarian Navy  that the  First World War  would not be a short one, [1]  they moved to bolster their U-boat fleet by seizing the plans for the Danish  Havmanden  class submarines , [6]  three of which had been built at  Whitehead & Co.  in  Fiume . [5]  Although the Austro-Hungarian Navy was not happy with the design, which was largely obsolete, [7] [8]  it was the only design for which plans were available and which could be begun immediately in domestic shipyards. [8]  The Austro-Hungarian Navy unenthusiastically placed orders for  U-21  and her three  sister boats  on 27 March 1915. [1]

U-21  was one of two boats of the class to be built at the  Pola Navy Yard . [6]  Due to demands by the Hungarian government, [1]  subcontracts for the class were divided between Hungarian and Austrian firms, [2]  and this politically expedient solution worsened technical problems with the design, resulting in numerous modifications and delays for the class in general. [6]

U-21  was an ocean-going submarine that displaced 173 metric tons (170 long tons) surfaced and 210 metric tons (207 long tons) submerged and was designed for a complement of 18. She was 127 feet 2 inches (38.76 m) long with a  beam  of 13 feet (4.0 m) and a  draft  of 9 feet (2.7 m). For propulsion, she featured a single shaft, a single 450 bhp (340 kW)  diesel engine  for surface running, and a single 160 shp (120 kW) electric motor for submerged travel. [2]  She was capable of 12 knots (22 km/h) while surfaced and 9 knots (17 km/h) while submerged. Although there is no specific notation of a range for  U-21 , the  Havmanden  class, upon which the  U-20  class was based, had a range of 1,400 nautical miles (2,600 km) at 10 knots (19 km/h), surfaced, and 23 nautical miles (43 km) at 8 knots (15 km/h) submerged. [5]

U-21  was armed with two 45 cm (17.7 in)  torpedo tubes  located in the front and carried a complement of two  torpedoes . She was also equipped with a  66 mm (2.6 in)   deck gun  and an 8 mm (0.31 in)  machine gun . [2]

U-21  was  launched  on 15 August 1916, the first of the four  U-20 -class boats. [2]  During a diving trial in January 1917, the submarine was damaged when it sank too deep, requiring repairs that took place over the next seven months.  U-21  was  commissioned  on 15 August under the command of  Linienschiffsleutnant  Hugo von Seyffertitz. [3] [4]  A 31-year-old native of  Brixen , von Seyffertitz was a first-time U-boat commander. [9]

Ten days after commissioning,  U-21  safely submerged to a depth of 42 metres (138 ft). However, her nose was dented when she hit bottom on another test dive in September, necessitating more repairs. On 29 September, von Seyffertitz steered the boat from the submarine base at  Brioni  to  Cattaro , where she arrived on 1 October. On 4 October,  U-21  set out for a patrol off the coast of  Albania , but had returned to Cattaro by mid October. [3]

On 15 October, von Seyffertitz and  U-21  departed from Cattaro to begin their first  Mediterranean  deployment. Slated to sail into the  Ionian Sea ,  U-21  instead had to turn back the following day when the main  hatch  seal on the  conning tower  leaked and could not be repaired. After her 18 October return to Cattaro, she sailed for Pola, arriving on 24 October. There, she would undergo another lengthy stay in port for repairs. [3]  While  U-21  was under repair, von Seyffertitz was transferred to  U-47 . [9]

Linienschiffleutnant  Robert Dürrial was assigned the new commander of  U-21  on 24 March 1918. The 26-year-old  Galician  had served as commander of  U-10  for four months in 1917. [10]  Dürrial led  U-21  out of Pola on 1 June for Cattaro, making stops en route at  Arbe  and  Novigrad  for repairs to the  gyrocompass . [3]

On 16 July, while conducting patrols off the  Albanian  coast, a  piston  in  U-21 ' s diesel engine broke and Dürrial put in at  Djenovic . On 25 July,  U-21  was towed to Pola, [3]  where she remained until the end of the war. [11]  She was ceded to Italy as a  war reparation  and scrapped in 1920. [6]  Like all of her sister boats, [6]   U-21  had no wartime successes. [4]
