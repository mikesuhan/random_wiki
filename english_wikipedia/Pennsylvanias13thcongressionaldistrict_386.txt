The  13th Congressional District of Pennsylvania  is located in Southeastern Pennsylvania, covering eastern  Montgomery County  and Northeast  Philadelphia . The district traditionally included most of Montgomery County, but was redrawn in 2002 to include part of Philadelphia, and altered again in 2012.  Democrat   Brendan Boyle  has represented the district since 2015.

The district had long been a  Republican  stronghold, like many suburban districts in the Northeast. However, the brand of Republicanism in this district was a moderate one, and the district (like the Philadelphia suburbs as a whole) became friendlier to Democrats during the 1990s as the national party veered to the right. The district has not voted Republican for President since 1988. In 1992, the district elected its first Democratic representative in 86 years,  Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky . She was swept out in 1994 by Republican  Jon D. Fox , but  Joe Hoeffel  regained the seat for the Democrats in 1998. It has been in Democratic hands since then, and became even more Democratic since being pushed into Philadelphia after the 2000 census.
