Lewin's rails are not listed as threatened on the Australian  Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 . However, their conservation status varies from state to state within Australia. For example:

The Lewin's rail is listed as threatened on the Victorian  Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act (1988) . [4]  Under this Act, an  Action Statement  for the recovery and future management of this species has not yet been prepared.

On the 2007 advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna in Victoria, the Lewin's rail is listed as  vulnerable . [6]

A subspecies of Lewin's rail, listed as Lewin's water rail ( Rallus pectoralis clelandi ), is on Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation (Specially Protected Fauna) Notice 2008 Schedule 2 â€” Fauna presumed to be extinct, under the WA  Wildlife Conservation Act 1950 .

Along  Kedron Brook  in Brisbane, the bird is described as rare and threatened.

This was later expanded to 49 hectares to provide a more appropriate vegetation corridor.
