Lee Dong-jun  (born  Daniel Sandrin  on 27 January 1980), is an American-born  South Korean  basketball player. [1]

Lee began his basketball career playing for the  University of Portland  in the 1998–1999 season, appearing in eight games and scoring an average of 106.5 points. He transferred to  Seattle Pacific University  in 2000. [2]  After his graduation, he went on to play on professional teams in  Luxembourg  and  Germany  before coming to  South Korea  in 2006. [1]

In South Korea, Lee joined  Yonsei University 's team in March 2006. [1]  Lee's participation in university basketball was controversial because he was not a South Korean citizen and he had previously played in professional leagues in Europe. Even after he naturalised,  Korea University  continued to object to his participation due to his professional experience; after he was ruled ineligible, a physical altercation broke out at a September 2006 match between Yonsei University and Korea University. [1]  Coming to South Korea was a difficult adjustment for Lee in terms of culture and language. [3]  Philippine Olympic Committee president  Monico Puentevella  stated in media interviews that Sandrin had told him "he couldn’t relate with the Koreans because they hardly speak English … he felt more comfortable with our team. [4]  Nevertheless, Lee stated that he relished the opportunity to live in the country and learn more about his roots. [3]

Lee would go on to play professionally in the  Korean Basketball League  for the  Daegu Orions . [3]  He later moved to the  Seoul Samsung Thunders . In January 2013 he and elder brother  Lee Seung-jun  were booked on assault charges in  Mapo District , leading to controversy over whether they should be permitted to play in the then-ongoing KBL All-Star Games. [5]

On November 21, 2016, it was announced that Lee would serve as one of two  Alab Pilipinas ' world imports together with his brother  Lee Seung-jun . [6]

Lee was born into a basketball family: his father was an avid player, and taught the game to Lee's older brother and then to Lee himself. [3]  He graduated from  Bothell High School  in 1998 before going on to the  University of Portland  and then  Seattle Pacific University . [2]  He naturalised as a  South Korean citizen  in June 2006, relinquishing his  United States citizenship  in the process. [1] [7]  His elder brother Eric Sandrin followed him to South Korea and in 2009 also naturalised as a South Korean citizen, changing his name to Lee Seung-jun. [8]
