5, N -dimethyl- N -isopropyltryptamine  (5-Me-MiPT) is a  tryptamine  derivative that is thought to be a  psychedelic drug . It was first made in 1989.  In vitro  binding experiments on brain homogenates showed it to have a binding affinity between that of  MiPT  and  5-MeO-MiPT , [1]  both of which are known to be active psychedelics in humans.
