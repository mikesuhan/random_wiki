Bölscheøya  (English: Bölsche Island) is an island southwest of  Negerpynten , the southeastern point of  Edgeøya . It is part of  Thousand Islands . The island was named in 1868 by the  German  geographer  August Petermann  (1822–78) after the  German  journalist  Carl Bölsche , father of the  German  writer and zoologist  Wilhelm Bölsche  (1843–93). The remains of a  whaling  station (probably  Dutch ) from the 17th century can be found on the island.
