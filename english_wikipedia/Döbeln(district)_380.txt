Döbeln  is a former district in the  Free State of Saxony ,  Germany . It was bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of  Torgau-Oschatz ,  Riesa-Großenhain ,  Meißen ,  Mittweida  and  Muldentalkreis .

The region was originally populated by  Sorbic peoples . In the early Middle Ages, the  Daleminzian  people settled along this section of the Mulde River. They were driven away by Germans after the  Battle of Jahna  in 928.

The present borders of the district were established in 1952, when the government of  East Germany  formed the new districts. Döbeln was one of the few districts which had not been changed directly after the  German reunification . In August 2008, as a part of the district reform in Saxony, the districts of Döbeln, Freiberg and Mittweida were merged into the new district  Mittelsachsen .

The district was located on the banks of the  Freiberger Mulde  in the triangle between the cities of  Dresden ,  Leipzig  and  Chemnitz .
