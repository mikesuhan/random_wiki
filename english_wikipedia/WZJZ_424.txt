WZJZ  (100.1  MHz ) is a commercial  FM   radio station   licensed  to  Port Charlotte, Florida , [1]  and broadcasting to the  Fort Myers / Southwest Florida   media market . WZJZ is owned by  iHeartMedia, Inc.  and airs a  hot adult contemporary  music  format  branded as "Y100.1".

The station's studios and offices are on Metro Parkway in Fort Myers. [2]  The  transmitter  is off Horseshoe Road in  Punta Gorda . [3]  With a good radio, WZJZ's 84,000  watt  signal can be heard from  Bradenton, Florida  to  Lake Okechobee  to  Everglades City .

WZJZ broadcasts in the  HD Radio  format. [4]

In 1976, the station first  signed on  at 100.1 MHz in Port Charlotte. It had the  call sign   WEEJ  and was powered at 3000  watts . [5]  It began with an all  disco  format [6]  Through most of the 1980s it had an  adult contemporary  sound until switching formats various times through the 1990s. In 2003, it took the call letters  WCKT  as "Cat Country 100."

On March 21, 2007, when it was a  Smooth Jazz  station, WZJZ moved from 107.1 FM to 100.1 FM, swapping frequencies with co-owned  country music  station  WCKT . WCKT is now heard at 107.1, while WZJZ continues at 100.1, with both stations getting sizable signal improvements, going from  Class A  to Class C.

On March 29, 2009, at midnight, WZJZ began to repeatedly play the same portion of the song  I Like To Move It  by  Reel 2 Real  as a  stunt  in preparation for a format change. The new station was slated to be called Move 100.1. On March 30, 2009 WZJZ flipped to an upbeat  rhythmic adult contemporary  sound and adopted the "Z100" moniker. Its logo was patterned after its  Top 40   sister stations   KKRZ  in  Portland, Oregon , and  WHTZ  in  New York, New York .

On July 25, 2011, after a weekend of stunting, WZJZ flipped to Top 40 (CHR), using the moniker  Y100  even though there is no  Y  in the call letters. [7]  The station's format and logo is patterned after its sister station in nearby  Miami ,  WHYI , but is customized for Southwest Floridians. The flip to Top 40 gave iHeartMedia two Top 40 stations in the Fort Myers market, along with  rhythmic contemporary   WBTT . In 2013, Y100 once again switched its logo to match WHYI, but with some slight differences.

On March 24, 2016 at midnight, WZJZ tweaked its format to Hot AC and began billing itself as "Y100.1".
