Redbridge Cycling Centre  is a road cycle circuit and mountain bike course at  Hog Hill  – near  Hainault Forest Country Park  and directly opposite the  Forest Cemetery & Crematorium . The £5m cost of the facility was funded by the  London Development Agency  (LDA) as a replacement the former Eastway cycle facilities that were redeveloped for the  London Olympic Park . The LDA will be funding the facility up to the completion of the legacy  London Velopark . It was opened by  Boris Johnson  in August 2008. [1]

In 2014, Redbridge Council agreed to purchase Redbridge Cycling Centre from the  Crown Estate  using a grant from the  London Marathon  Charitable Trust. [2]
