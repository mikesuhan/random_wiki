Porpoloma umbrosum , commonly known as the  amyloid tricholoma , [2]  is a species of  fungus  in the family  Tricholomataceae , and the  type species  of the genus  Porpoloma . It was first  described  scientifically by mycologists  Alexander H. Smith  and Maurice B. Walters in 1943 as a species of  Tricholoma . [3]   Rolf Singer  transferred it to  Porpoloma  ( subgenus   Pseudotricholoma ) in 1962. [4]  The mushroom is found in North America, where it fruits singly or in small groups under  conifer  trees. Although it resembles  Tricholoma  species, it is distinguished from that genus by its  amyloid   spores . [2]
