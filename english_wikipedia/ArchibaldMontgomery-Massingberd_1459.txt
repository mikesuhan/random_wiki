Field Marshal   Sir Archibald Armar Montgomery-Massingberd ,  GCB ,  GCVO ,  KCMG ,  DL  (6 December 1871 – 13 October 1947), known as  Archibald Armar Montgomery  until October 1926, was a senior  British Army   officer  who served as  Chief of the Imperial General Staff  (CIGS) from 1933 to 1936. He served in the  Second Boer War  and in the  First World War , and later was the driving force behind the formation of a permanent  "Mobile Division" , the fore-runner of the 1st Armoured Division.

Born the son of  Hugh de Fellenberg Montgomery , a landowner and  Ulster Unionist  politician, and Mary Sophia Juliana May Montgomery (née Maude) [1]  and educated at  Charterhouse School  and at the  Royal Military Academy, Woolwich , Archibald Armar Montgomery was commissioned a  second lieutenant  in the  Royal Field Artillery  on 4 November 1891. [2]  He was posted to a field battery in India in 1892 [3]  and became a  lieutenant  on 4 November 1894. [4]  He served with the Royal Field Artillery during the  Second Boer War [3]  and took part in the  Battle of Magersfontein  and the  Battle of Paardeberg . [1]  Having been promoted to  captain  on 8 March 1900, [5]  he was  mentioned in despatches  on 4 September 1901. [6]

After the War Montgomery served as a battery captain at  Bulford Camp  before attending  Staff College, Camberley  from 1905 to 1906. [3]  He became a staff captain at the Inspectorate of Horse and Field Artillery in 1907 and a staff officer at  Aldershot Command  in 1908. [3]  Promoted to  major  on 5 June 1909, [7]  he was appointed a general staff officer at the  Indian Army Staff College  at  Quetta  in India on 9 February 1912. [8]

At the outbreak of the  First World War  in July 1914 Montgomery was appointed a general staff officer to the  British Expeditionary Force  (BEF) in France. [3]  He was appointed Chief of Staff at  IV Corps  in France in October 1914. [3]  Promoted to  lieutenant colonel  on 16 May 1915, [9]  he became Chief of Staff of  Fourth Army  of the BEF in February 1916, [3]  a role which, according to Field Marshal  Sir Douglas Haig , from the planning for the  Battle of the Somme  in 1916 he carried out with "great ability and success". [10]  Promoted to the substantive rank of  major general  on 1 January 1917, [3]  he was appointed a  Companion of the Order of the Bath  for his services in the field on 1 January 1918. [11]  He was effectively Deputy Commander of the Fourth Army (deputising for General  Sir Henry Rawlinson ) in the final months of the War and played an important role in the success of the  Battle of Amiens . [12]  He was appointed a  Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George  for his services in connection with military operations in France and Flanders on 1 January 1919 [13]  and was also awarded the  American Distinguished Service Medal  by the  President of the United States  on 12 July 1919. [14]

Montgomery was appointed Chief of Staff of the  British Army of the Rhine  following the War and then Deputy Chief of the General Staff in India on 27 March 1920 [15]  before becoming  General Officer Commanding   53rd (Welsh) Division  on 3 March 1922. [16]  He became General Officer Commanding  1st Infantry Division  at  Aldershot  on 4 June 1923 [17]  and, having been advanced to  Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath  in the  New Year Honours  1925, [18]  he was promoted to  lieutenant general  on 16 March 1926. [12]  Following a two-year break on half-pay, he became  General Officer Commanding   Southern Command  on 17 June 1928. [19]  Promoted to  general  on 1 October 1930, [20]  he was appointed  Adjutant-General to the Forces  on 1 March 1931 [21]  and made  Aide-de-Camp General  to  the King  on 3 March 1931. [22]

He was appointed  Chief of the Imperial General Staff  in February 1933. [12]  Among his main achievements at this time was the mechanising of the  cavalry : [23]  indeed he was the driving force behind the formation of a permanent  "Mobile Division" . [24]  Despite this, according to Williamson and Millett, he was a great obstacle to innovation of mechanized forces and suppressed the analysis of the British Army's performance in the First World War initiated by his predecessor,  Lord Milne . [25]  Advanced to  Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath  in the  King's Birthday Honours  1934, [26]  he was made a  field marshal  on 7 June 1935. [27]  Following the death of  King George V  he took part in the funeral procession in January 1936 [28]  and then retired in March 1936. [12]

He was also from Colonel Commandant of the Royal Regiment of Artillery from 19 November 1927, [29]  Colonel Commandant of the  Royal Tank Corps  from 7 December 1934, [30]  Colonel Commandant of the  20th Burma Rifles  from 5 April 1935, [31]  Honorary Colonel of the 46th (Lincolnshire Reserve) Anti-Aircraft Battalion from 17 March 1937 [32]  and Colonel Commandant of the Royal Malta Artillery from 11 May 1937. [33]

In retirement he became  Deputy Lieutenant [34]  and then Vice-Lieutenant of the  County of Lincoln . [35]  During the  Second World War  the  Air Ministry  attempted to build an airfield at  Great Steeping  in  Lincolnshire  that would have extended into Sir Archibald's wife's traditional family estate, necessitating the demolition of the magnificent mansion of  Gunby Hall . He personally appealed to  King George VI  and the  Air Ministry  relented, redrawing the plans that resulted in the resiting of the new RAF Spilsby two miles further south. [36]  During the Second World War he also took charge of organizing and recruiting the  Home Guard  in Lincolnshire for nine months. [1]  His major passion in life was  horsemanship . [1]  He died at his home,  Gunby Hall , on 13 October 1947 [12]  and was buried at St. Peter's Church in  Gunby . [37]

He married Diana Langton Massingberd in 1896, and, in October 1926, changed his name by Royal Licence in order to take her surname hyphenated to his own, [38]  when she inherited family estates (meaning references to "Montgomery-Massingberd" during the First World War are anachronistic); they had no children. [12]  The journalist and genealogist  Hugh Massingberd  was great-nephew both to the Field Marshal and, independently, to the Field Marshal's wife. [39]
