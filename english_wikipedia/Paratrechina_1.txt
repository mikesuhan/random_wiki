Paratrechina  is an  ant   genus  from the  subfamily   Formicinae  ( tribe   Plagiolepidini ). Five species are included in this genus, one of which, the  longhorn crazy ant  ( Paratrechina longicornis ), is a widespread pest. [2]

In 2010, the genus  Paratrechina  (broad sense) was found to be  paraphyletic , with all but one species being transferred to the revived genera  Nylanderia  and  Paraparatrechina . The sole remaining species within  Paratrechina  was  Paratrechina longicornis . The discovery of  Paratrechina  (broad sense) paraphyly was not particularly surprising, because  Paratrechina longicornis  possesses a  morphology  that had long been noted as being different from other members of the genus with especially elongated scapes, head and  tibiae , coupled with a distinctly shaped  mesosoma  and unusual mesosomal setal pattern.
