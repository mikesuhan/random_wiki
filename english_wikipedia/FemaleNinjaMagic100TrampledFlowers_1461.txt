Female Ninja Magic: 100 Trampled Flowers   ( くノ一淫法　百花卍がらみ ,   Kunoichi inpo: hyakka manji-garimi )  is a  1974   Japanese  film in  Nikkatsu 's  Roman porno  series, directed by  Chūsei Sone  and starring  Junko Miyashita .

In historical times, the Shogun family employs a group of  Iga  ninjas to take over the Akizuki clan's lands. The Akizuki hire the Fumi ninjas, a group of female warriors who enhance their fighting ability with sexual magic such as the "white snake spell". When the Akizuki emerge victorious, Tsukinojo, the leader of the Fumi ninjas, marries Lord Akizuki. [2] [3]

The film anticipates the theme of Toei's  In Bed With the Enemy: Female Ninjas  (1976) which itself spawned several imitations. In their  Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films , the Weissers write that this indicates Nikkatsu's ability to keep current with the moods of popular culture. [3]  During the mid-1970s, when director Sone's output was uneven, the Weissers judge the film to show him at his best. [5]  It also serves as an example, they write, of popular actress Yūko Katagiri's variable career. Previously promoted as a star, her career had stalled due to her typecasting in teenage roles. She had expanded her acting range by starring in  Tatsumi Kumashiro 's successful  Wet Lust: 21 Strippers  (1974). [6]  By the time of the release of  Female Ninja Magic: 100 Trampled Flowers , however, her star had again faded and she was relegated to fourth billing. [3]   Allmovie  writes that the film is an "action-packed softcore melodrama". [2]

Female Ninja Magic: 100 Trampled Flowers  was released theatrically in Japan on August 3, 1974. [1]  It was released to home video in VHS format on December 2, 1996. [7]
