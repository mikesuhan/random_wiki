New Venture Gear , a division of  Magna Powertrain , was an  automobile  and  light truck   transmission  company that was started in 1990 as the first ever  joint venture  between any of the Big Three US automakers.  General Motors  and  Chrysler Corporation  were the participants. Operation and management of Chrysler's New Process Gear  Syracuse, New York , plant and GM's underutilized  Muncie, Indiana , Hydramatic transmission plant were shifted to New Venture Gear Company. [1]

In 1902 Thomas W. Warner formed the Warner Gear Company in  Muncie, Indiana , to manufacture automobile parts, steering, and transmission gears. In 1919, General Motors purchased the T.W. Warner Company, including its land and buildings. In 1920 GM reopened the plant under the name Muncie Products to manufacture transmissions and steering gear for their  Oakland ,  Pontiac ,  Oldsmobile ,  Chevrolet , and  GMC -Truck divisions. In 1932 GM closed the Muncie Products plant and consolidated operations to other divisions in response to the  failing economy . The Chevrolet division re-opened the plant in 1935 to build car and truck transmissions. World War II halted non military vehicle production and the plant was converted to serve the US military demand till the war ended. The 1950s and 60s saw expansion and growth. In the 1970s and 80s GM swapped the plant to many different GM divisions ending with Detroit Diesel Allison in 1984 and GM Hydramatic in 1986. [2]  In 1990 Hydramatic Muncie plant became part of the GM-Chrysler New Venture Gear. In February 2002 General Motors sold its minority 36% stake in the New Venture Gear company to  DaimlerChrysler  and the Muncie Transmission plant reverted to GM control. GM changed the plant name to  "Manual Transmissions Of Muncie" . The T.W. Warner Muncie plant closed in mid-2006 after a Century in operation and the property was turned over to Delaware County Indiana. The GM Muncie Transmission plant was demolished soon after turnover to the county. [3]

In 1888 Thomas W. Meachem founded the New Process Rawhide Company in  Baldwinsville, New York.  In the late 1890s New Process Rawhide moved operations to Syracuse after a fire. In 1913 Thomas W. Meachem reorganized New Process Rawhide with one of his partners, Artemus Vosburgh. The company was renamed New Process Gear to reflect the new corporate direction. In 1954, after a succession of owners including Willys-Overland, [4]  New Process Gear became a subsidiary of Chrysler Corporation. [5]  In 1990, under a new joint GMâ€“Chrysler venture, New Process Gear was renamed "New Process Gear Division" of New Venture Gear. In 1998 Daimler Benz merged with Chrysler to form  Daimler Chrysler . In 2002 Daimler Chrysler bought the entire 36% minority stake in New Venture Gear from GM while retaining ownership of the Syracuse New Process facilities. In 2004 Canada based Magna International purchased 80% of New Venture Gear from Daimler Chrysler. In 2007 Magna purchased the remaining 20% interest. The New Process gear plant remained property of  Daimler Chrysler . Chrysler then leased the facilities to Magna. [6]  This lease arrangement made it difficult to compete with the European manufacturing operation Magna directly purchased located in Roitzsch Germany. [7]  A downturn in Jeep demand combined with DaimlerChrysler not replacing the Dodge Neon sharply curtailed demand for the Syracuse New Process Gear plant production. In 2009 design and engineering services were moved to Troy, Michigan, and Magna International announced its intent to close the Syracuse plant. The Syracuse New Process Gear plant planned closure in November 2011 was pushed out till first quarter of 2012. [8]  After 124 years, on Thursday, August 24, 2012, New Process Gear ended production and closed their doors for the last time. [9]

The Muncie, Indiana, plant under New Venture Gear produced the  NV4500 ,  NV3500 , and  NV3550  light truck transmissions.

The Syracuse New Process Gear plant produced transfer cases for all of the "Big Three"  Ford ,  Chrysler , and  General Motors . The NV 247  all-wheel drive  transfer case, sold by Chrysler's  Jeep  division as the "Quadra-Trac II", the manual transaxle for the Dodge Neon and PT Cruiser (T-350), and manual transaxles for European export Chrysler minivans (T-650 & 750) were the bulk of their last years of production.
