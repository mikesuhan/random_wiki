The  International Hockey Hall of Fame  ( IHHOF ) and Museum is a museum dedicated to the history of ice hockey in Canada, located in  Kingston ,  Ontario . The IHHOF was originally planned to be the one Hockey Hall of Fame but events led to the establishment of the  Hockey Hall of Fame  in  Toronto  instead. [1]

IHHOF has been renamed the Original Hockey Hall of Fame. It now focuses on the history of the sport, with emphasis on the role people from Kingston had in its development.

The hall is open Thursday to Sunday from 12 noon to 6 pm. Admission is by donation.

The International Hockey Hall of Fame was founded on September 10, 1943, and incorporated as a non-profit  charity  by the  National Hockey League  and the  Canadian Amateur Hockey Association . It was established through the efforts of  James T. Sutherland , a former President of the CAHA, who sought to establish it in Kingston because he believed that the city was the birthplace of hockey. [2]  In 1943, the NHL and CAHA reached an agreement that a Hall of Fame would be established in Kingston. [2]  The first players were inducted on April 30, 1945, although the IHHOF still did not have a permanent home. [3]

Kingston lost its most influential advocate as permanent site of the Hockey Hall of Fame when Sutherland died in 1955. [4]  By 1958, the IHHOF organizers had still not raised sufficient funds to construct a permanent building in Kingston.  Clarence Campbell , then President of the NHL, grew tired of waiting for the construction to begin and withdrew the NHL's support, [5]  subsequently reaching an agreement with the  Canadian National Exhibition  to establish a new Hall of Fame building in Toronto.

Despite this major setback, the Board of Directors of the International Hockey Hall of Fame moved forward. In 1962, a grant was awarded by the City of Kingston for the construction of a new building. In 1965 the International Hockey Hall of Fame moved into their new building located on the Memorial Centre grounds in Kingston. In 1992, the IHHOF added new exhibits from the International Ice Hockey Federation. The IIHF exhibits were located at the IHHOF from 1992 through 1997. The IIHF relocated them to the HHOF in Toronto, in 1998.

The hall is now located at the Invista Centre, a four-pad arena located at 1350 Gardiners Road. The hall is on the second floor of the facility.

The museum had two floors at their original home at 277 York Street. The first had exhibits about  Bobby Orr ,  Don Cherry , the  Original Six ,  Wayne Gretzky  and others. The second floor had a display of the Hall of Fame's inductees, plus exhibits about Kingston and area professional hockey players, the  World Hockey Association , and the evolution of ice skates and hockey sticks. Artifacts included jerseys worn by  Gordie Howe ,  Rocket Richard  and others, skates and sticks from the 1800s and the championship banner of the 1914  Toronto Blueshirts . Outside of the building was an oversized square "puck".

The York Street building was demolished in 2012. Since then, the hall has moved to the  Invista Centre  (1350 Gardiners Road). The hall has been renamed the Original Hockey Hall of Fame. In spring 2016, the hall reopened with new exhibits and multimedia presentations, including a film,  The Cradle of Hockey , narrated by  Don Cherry .

The hall is open Thursday to Sunday from 12 noon to 6 pm. Admission is by donation.

The IHHOF inducted nine builders and 32 players, but only two since 1952 and none since 1966.

Each February since 1969 the IHHOF presents its annual Historic Hockey Series. The series is both a competition and demonstration of the first organized hockey game played on the  Kingston Harbour  in 1886 between  Queen's University  and the  Royal Military College of Canada . The original style  sticks  and uniforms as well as the original rules of that era are used including a square  puck , seven players per side and with no forward passing. Queen’s University and the Royal Military College of Canada compete along with the 2nd Regiment from the  Royal Canadian Horse Artillery  from  Petawawa  who represent the garrison soldiers stationed in Kingston in the 1880s in a round-robin tournament. Since 2006, the series has been held on the outdoor rink at Kingston’s downtown historic Market Square. [6] [7]
