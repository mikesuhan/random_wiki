Moshe Idel  ( Hebrew : משה אידל) is a Romanian born historian and philosopher of Jewish mysticism. He is Emeritus Max Cooper Professor in Jewish Thought at the  Hebrew University , Jerusalem, and a Senior Researcher at the  Shalom Hartman Institute .

Born in  Târgu Neamț ,  Romania , in 1947, Idel was a precocious child, with a passion for reading which made him read all the books in the town, cooperative, then High school Library, in addition to buying more books with the money earned by singing at weddings. [1]  Although the  Holocaust  did not directly affect the Jewish population of Târgu Neamț, they were affected by the so-called  “population displacements” . In 1963 he immigrated with his family to Israel. [2]

Enrolled at the  Hebrew University , he studied under  Gershom Scholem . After earning his doctorate with a thesis on  Abraham Abulafia , he eventually succeeded  Scholem  to the chair of Jewish Thought. He has served as visiting Professor at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America ,  UCLA ,  Yale ,  Harvard ,  Princeton ,  University of Pennsylvania  and the  Collège de France . [3]

Idel has undertaken a systematic revision of the history and analysis of  Jewish mysticism . His explorations of the mythical, theurgical, mystical, and messianic dimensions of Judaism have been attentive to history, sociology, and anthropology, while rejecting a naïve historicist approach to Judaism. [4]  His 1988 work,  Kabbalah: New Perspectives  ( Yale University Press ), is said to have revolutionised  Kabbalah  studies. [5]  His historical and phenomenological studies of rabbinic, philosophic, kabbalistic, and Hasidic texts have transformed the understanding of Jewish intellectual history and highlighted the close relationship between magic, mysticism, and liturgy. [4]

In 1999, Idel was awarded the  Israel Prize  for excellent achievement in the field of Jewish philosophy, and in 2002 the  EMET Prize  for Jewish Thought. [6]  In 2003, he received the  Koret Award  for Jewish philosophy for his book  Absorbing Perfections . [1]  He has been conferred  honorary doctorates  by the universities of  Yale , [ citation needed ]   Budapest , [ citation needed ]   Haifa , [7]   Cluj , [ citation needed ]   Iasi [8]  and  Bucharest .
