Actinopolyspora halophila  is a bacterium. [1]  It differs from its cogenerate bacteria in the make-up of its cell wall. [2]  Like all Actinopolyspora,  A. halophila  requires saline conditions for survival, however wild types generally require more than 12% salt concentration to grow, and can grow in concentrations of up to 30%.
