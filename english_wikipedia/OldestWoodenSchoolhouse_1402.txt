The  Oldest Wooden School House  is a wooden structure located at 14 St. George Street in  St. Augustine, Florida  near the city gate. It is touted as being the oldest wooden school building in the United States. The exact date of construction is unknown, but it first appears on tax records in 1716. There are no extant wooden buildings in St. Augustine built prior to 1702 when the British burned the city. The oldest schoolhouse still standing in the United States is the  Voorlezer's House  built prior to 1696 and located in  Historic Richmondtown  in  Staten Island , New York. [1] [2] [3]

The Oldest Wooden School House is encircled by a large chain, placed there in 1937, to help anchor it to the ground in case of a hurricane. The walls are made of  bald cypress  and  red cedar  which are held together by wooden pins and iron spikes but it has had recent maintenance such as a new roof among other fixes.

The schoolmaster and family lived on the second floor above the classroom and the kitchen was located in a separate building to reduce heat and threat of fire. [4]  The building originally belonged to Juan Genoply. The classroom was one of the first in the US to be  co-ed , educating both boys and girls since 1788.  [5]

The school is open every day except Christmas from 9 to 5 with extended summer hours. The facility features a self-guided tour with an animatronic professor and student giving a brief history on the house. There are also numerous items with information posted around the building to read. Gardens located behind the house feature exhibits of the kitchen, a rebuilt outhouse, an old well, and a sculpture garden displaying busts of famous educators. The statuary was part of a project known as  The Grove of Educators  which sought to gather statues of educators from every country in the Americas, though only a few countries participated.  [5]
