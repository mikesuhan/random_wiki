The  Cape Hope Islands  are an uninhabited  Canadian arctic islands  group located within the midsection of  James Bay  in  Nunavut ,  Canada . They are situated south of Vieux-Comptoir (Old Factory).

The  Inuit  who lived on the Cape Hope Islands in the 1930s were transferred by the government to  Great Whale River  in 1960. [1]  They now live in  Kuujjuarapik, Quebec , and there is no longer a permanent settlement on the Cape Hope Islands.
