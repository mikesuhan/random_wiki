[2]  He and two others free themselves during a prison breakout, during which all the guards and crew are killed, and take control of the space ship, steering it into the lawless reaches of the Backspace.

The variety of weapons that can be used in the game ranges from shotguns to grenades to axes. [1]

After the completion of each level, the player gets a ranking from 1-5 "stars" indicating how well they performed. [1]  The rating in stars is based on various factors such as the number of player deaths, the number of high-value targets eliminated, and the number of clues found. [3]  The more stars a player earns, the more rewards are available for them to unlock at the end of the level. [1]  These rewards include weapons, bombs, distraction devices, and armor.

The player can switch between offensive mode and stealth mode. [1]  In offensive mode, the player has the advantage of being able to run quickly. In stealth mode, the player cannot be shot when behind a fence, bush, oil can, or other types of objects. However, in stealth mode, the player has to walk at a far slower pace. [3]

The player has access to limited ammunition in the game. [1]  Every type of weapon has limited ammunition available, and if the player runs out of ammunition for that specific weapon, then they can no longer use it until they pick up more ammunition which can be found lying in various parts of each level's map. [7]  Each type of weapon has a maximum amount of ammunition that can be held for it at any one time.
