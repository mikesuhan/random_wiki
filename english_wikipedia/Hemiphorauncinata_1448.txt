Hemiphora uncinata  is a  flowering plant  in the mint  family   Lamiaceae  and is endemic to the  south-west  of  Western Australia . It is an erect, spreading shrub with its branches densely covered with white, woolly hairs. Its leaves are rough and wrinkled and the flowers are tube-shaped with deep pink  petals  with wavy edges.

Hemiphora uncinata  is an erect, spreading shrub which grows to a height of 30–60 cm (10–20 in) with its branches covered with white, cottony hairs. The leaves are linear to lance-shaped, 10–35 mm (0.4–1 in) long, 1–4 mm (0.04–0.2 in) wide, with their edges curved downwards or under and often have a hooked tip. The upper surface is rough and wrinkled with small blisters and the lower surface is covered with woolly hairs at least when young. [2] [3]

The flowers are deep pink and are arranged singly or in groups of up to three on woolly stalks 2–4 mm (0.08–0.2 in) long, in upper leaf  axils . There are  bracts  10–15 mm (0.4–0.6 in) long at the base of the flowers and which are  glabrous  on the inner surface and densely woolly outside, and there are shorter, glabrous  bracteoles . The five  sepals  are 6–8 mm (0.2–0.3 in) long, and joined at their base to form a short tube. The sepals are woolly on the outside, linear to lance-shaped and remain attached to the plant after the petals have fallen. The petals are 13–15 mm (0.5–0.6 in) long and joined to form a wide tube 7–10 mm (0.3–0.4 in) long and 5–7 mm (0.2–0.3 in) wide at the top end. The petal tube has soft hairs on the outside but glabrous inside except for a densely hairy ring above the  ovary . The five petal lobes form two "lips", the upper lip with two lobes joined for most of their length and the lower with three spreading lobes. The five lobes have wavy or irregularly notched edges and are roughly circular in shape, 4–6 mm (0.16–0.24 in) in diameter. The four  stamens  are shorter than the petal tube with the lower pair much longer than the upper pair. Flowering occurs in spring and the fruit is almost spherical, hairy, veiny and 2–3 mm (0.08–0.1 in) in diameter. This species is similar to  Hemiphora exserta  but has its stamens short and enclosed in the petal tube. [2] [3]

This species was first formally described in 1863 by  Nikolai Turczaninow  who gave it the name  Chloanthes uncinata . The description was published in  Bulletin de la Societe Imperiale des Naturalistes de Moscou  from a specimen collected by  James Drummond . [4] [5]  In 1870  George Bentham  changed the name to  Pityrodia uncinata [6] [7]  and in 2011, Barry Conn, Murray Henwood and Nicola Streiber transferred four species, including this one, from the genus  Pityrodia  into  Hemiphora . [1] [8]  The  specific epithet  ( uncinata ) is a  Latin  word meaning "hooked". [9]

Hemiphora uncinata  is mainly found in near-coastal areas between  Perth  and the  Murchison River , but there are  disjunct populations  near  Gairdner  and between  Hyden  and  Lake Cronin , in the  Geraldton Sandplains  and  Swan Coastal Plain   biogeographic regions [2] [3]  where it grows in sandy clay in depression that are sometimes flooded in winter. [10]

Hemiphora uncinata  is classified as "not threatened" by the Western Australian Government  Department of Parks and Wildlife . [3]
