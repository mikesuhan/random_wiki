HMPNGS  Buna  is a  Balikpapan  class  heavy  landing craft  operated by the  Papua New Guinea Defence Force  (PNGDF). Prior to 1974, the vessel was called  HMAS  Buna  (L 132)  and was operated by the  Royal Australian Navy  (RAN).

The eight-vessel  Balikpapan  class was ordered as a locally manufactured replacement for the  Australian Army 's  LSM-1 class landing ship medium  and  ALC 50  landing craft. [1]  They are 44.5 metres (146 ft) long, with a beam of 10.1 metres (33 ft), and a draught of 1.9 metres (6 ft 3 in). [2]  The  landing craft  have a standard displacement of 316 tons, with a full load displacement of 503 tons. [2]  They are propelled by two G.M. Detroit 6-71 diesel motors, providing 675 brake horsepower to the two propeller shafts, allowing the vessels to reach 9 knots (17 km/h; 10 mph). [2]  The standard ship's company is 13-strong. [2]  The  Balikpapan s are equipped with a Decca RM 916 navigational radar, and fitted with two 7.62 millimetres (0.300 in) machine guns for self-defence. [2]

The LCHs have a maximum payload of 180 tons; equivalent to 3  Leopard 1  tanks, 13  M113 armored personnel carriers  23 quarter-tonne trucks, or four  LARC-V  amphibious cargo vehicles. [2] [3]  As a troop transport, a  Balikpapan  class vessel can transport up to 400 soldiers between a larger amphibious ship and the shore, or embark 60 soldiers in six-berth caravans for longer voyages. [3] [4]  The vessel's payload affects the range: at 175 tons of cargo, each vessel has a range of 1,300 nautical miles (2,400 km; 1,500 mi), which increases to 2,280 nautical miles (4,220 km; 2,620 mi) with a 150-ton payload, and 3,000 nautical miles (5,600 km; 3,500 mi) when unladen. [2]  The flat, box-like keel causes the ships to roll considerably in other-than-calm conditions, limiting their ability to make long voyages. [3]

Buna  was laid down by  Walkers Limited  at  Maryborough, Queensland  on 31 July 1972, launched on 26 September 1972, and commissioned into the RAN on 7 December 1973. [5]

In April 1974,  Buna ,  Betano , and  Brunei  transited to  Lord Howe Island  as a demonstration of the  Balikpanan  class' oceangoing capabilities. [6]

On 14 November 1974,  Buna  was decommissioned from RAN service and transferred to the  Papua New Guinea Defence Force . She is still in service as of 2013. [7]
