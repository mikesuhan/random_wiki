Nakadōri Island [1]   ( 中通島 ,   Nakadōri-jima )  is an island in the  Gotō Islands , Japanese islands in the  East China Sea , off the western coast of  Kyūshū . The islands are a part of  Nagasaki Prefecture  in  Japan .

The island is roughly the same shape as a left hand held with the thumb and index finger extended. Thus, it is relatively long, narrow, and very mountainous. The roads are quite narrow and very curvy.

The island has been subject to two distinct periods of prosperity. These were the era of active trade with  China  until the 13th century and a more recent  whaling  boom that lasted until about fifty years ago. Both of these periods made this small rural area quite famous throughout Japan. The island has many interesting artifacts from both of these periods.

In August 2004, the five towns: Kamigotō, Shin-Uonome, Arikawa, Narao, Wakamatsu merged into a new town, appropriately named Shin-Kamigotō ( shin  means "new").
