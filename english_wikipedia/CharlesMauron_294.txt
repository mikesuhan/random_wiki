Charles Mauron  (1899–1966) was a French  translator  of contemporary English authors, including  E. M. Forster  and  Virginia Woolf , and a  literary critic  who made use of  Psychoanalytic literary criticism . He is noted for his books  Aesthetics and Psychology  (1935) and  Des métaphores obsédantes au mythe personnel  (1962). He was married from 1919 to 1949 to the writer  Marie Mauron  (1896-1986), and their home in  Saint-Rémy-de-Provence  became a focal-point in the inter-war years for their friends in the  Bloomsbury Group .

In 1963, Charles Mauron [2]  conceived a structured method to interpret literary works via  psychoanalysis . The study implied four different phases:

The author cannot be reduced to a ratiocinating self: his own more or less  traumatic  biographical past, the cultural  archetypes  that have suffused his "soul" ironically contrast with the conscious self, The chiasmic relation between the two tales may be seen as a sane and safe  acting out . A basically  unconscious  sexual impulse is symbolically fulfilled in a positive and socially gratifying way, a process known as  Sublimation .
