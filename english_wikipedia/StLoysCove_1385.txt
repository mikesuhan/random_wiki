St Loy's Cove  is a small wooded valley and beach in the  civil parish  of  St Buryan  in  Cornwall , England, UK. It is located two miles to the south of St Buryan churchtown, and between  Penberth  and  Lamorna . [1]  There are just a few buildings in the cove, one of which, Cove Cottage, provides bed and breakfast and a cafe. St Loy's is within the Cornwall  Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty  (AONB), the  Boscawen SSSI  ( Site of Special Scientific Interest ) and is part of a GCR  Geological Conservation Review  site. The  South West Coast Path  passes through the cove.

The stream at the bottom of the valley flows out to sea under a boulder  storm beach  backed by soft orangeâ€“brown cliffs of  head  deposits formed by  solifluction  when the climate was similar to that of Greenland's today. These cliffs are easily eroded and amongst the rounded boulders on the beach are irregular shaped granite stones that have fallen from the cliff. [2]

The Boscawen SSSI, which encompasses the whole of the cove, "is a nationally important site for  Quaternary   geomorphology  and Quaternary  stratigraphy . Coastal exposures at the site show a sequence of granitic shore platform overlain in turn by raised beach deposits and head deposits". [3]
