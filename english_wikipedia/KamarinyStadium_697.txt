The  Kamariny Stadium  was opened by the  Queen of England  in 1958. A plaque stands a few metres from the track that once bore her name. It is a public cinder track built to a British standard where four laps measures one imperial mile.

The stadium is 2Â km outside the town of  Iten , the capital of  Elgeyo-Marakwet County , in  Kenya .
