The Hogan building is a registered,  Texas  historical landmark. The tower is named for lawyer and oil entrepreneur  Thomas Stephen Hogan . For information on Hogan, see article on  Jacob Bunn . The design of the Petroleum Building, like the  Woolworth Building  in  New York City  and the  Baum Building  in  Oklahoma City , utilizes many classic architectural devices. Gothic spires and Moorish arches, lavish carved surfaces and opulent marble, all intended to clothe the business house with the respectability of a cathedral. Thomas Stephen Hogan intended his building to be a landmark and ( Fort Worth  architect-engineer) Wyatt Hedrick designed a building that people would talk about. However, behind the ornate cast-stone façade was (sic) functional reinforced concrete, the finest equipment available, and the determination of one man to establish Midland as the headquarters of the West Texas oil fields.
