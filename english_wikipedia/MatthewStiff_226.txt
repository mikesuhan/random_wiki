Matthew William Tansley Stiff  (born 13 December 1979 in  Grimsby ,  North East Lincolnshire ), also credited as  Matt Stiff , is an  English   opera singer  and former radio presenter, best known as the former  bass  singer with classical boyband  G4 .

The son of a  BT  engineer, [1]  Stiff began to play the  trombone  at the age of eight, but later made the transition to singing, [2]  after which he attended  Franklin College , [3]  then studied  Music  at the  University of Huddersfield  where he gained his BMus (Hons) and MA in Musical Performance. [4]  While in Huddersfield, he took singing lessons with vocal coach Paul Wade who described him as "a great pupil". [5]

As a student at Guildhall where he studied for a  Postgraduate diploma  in vocal training, Stiff replaced bass singer Tom Lowe to become a member of G4 which also included final year undergraduates  Jonathan Ansell ,  Mike Christie , and  Ben Thapa , who all started singing together to raise money and gain experience. In 2004 they later auditioned for the first series of  The X Factor  and despite placing second, signed a Â£1.5 million record deal with  Sony-BMG . Their first album, titled  G4  was released in February 2005 and achieved double-platinum status. They went on to produce two more albums:  G4 and Friends  and  G4 Act Three  with combined sales in excess of 1.5 million copies. [6] [7]

In 2007, after three years and three albums, G4 announced their split on  GMTV  due to disagreements within the band, [8]  with Stiff stating: "I want to make my own decisions without having to check with three other people first". [9]  Lead singer Ansell later admitted that the two of them had rowed the most. [10]

In 2008, following a schedule overhaul at  Classic FM , Stiff re-joined the station as a weekend presenter (he had previously hosted another show with the other members of G4), [11] [12] [13]  after which he returned to Guildhall in 2009 for a Master of Music Opera course, graduating with a Distinction in 2011. He has since joined a number of opera companies including the British Youth Opera where he played Kecal in  The Bartered Bride  to rave reviews. [14]
