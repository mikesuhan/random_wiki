TrES-4b  is an  extrasolar planet , and one of the largest exoplanets ever found, after  WASP-12b ,  WASP-17b ,  CT Chamaeleontis b  (though the latter may be a brown dwarf) and  HD 100546 b . It was discovered in 2006, and announced in 2007, by the  Trans-Atlantic Exoplanet Survey , using the  transit method . It is 1,430  light-years  (440  pc ) away at star  GSC 02620-00648 , in the constellation  Hercules . [2]

TrES-4 orbits its primary star every 3.543 days and eclipses it when viewed from  Earth . The planet is 0.919 times as massive as  Jupiter  but 1.799 times the diameter, the largest planet ever found at the time (next to  WASP-17b , found on 1 May 2009), giving it an average density of only about 0.333 grams per cubic centimetre. This made TrES-4 both the largest known planet and the planet with the lowest known density at the time of its discovery. [1] [2]

TrES-4's orbital radius is 0.05091  AU , giving it a predicted surface temperature of about 1782  K . This by itself is not enough to explain the planet's low density, however. It is not currently known why TrES-4 is so large. The probable causes are the proximity to a parent star that is 3–4 times more luminous than the  Sun  as well as the  internal heat  within the planet. [1] [2]

A 2008 study concluded that the GSC 06200-00648 system (among others) is a  binary star  system allowing even more accurate determination of stellar and planetary parameters. [1]
