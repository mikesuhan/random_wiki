The  Port of Bosaso , also known as  Bosaso Port , is the official  seaport  of  Bosaso , the commercial capital of the autonomous  Puntland  region in northeastern  Somalia . It is classified as a major class port. [1]

The modern Port of Bosaso was constructed during the mid-1980s by the  Siad Barre  administration for annual livestock shipments to the  Middle East .

In January 2012, a renovation project was launched at the Bosaso Port, with KMC contracted to upgrade the harbor. The initiative's first phase saw the clean-up of unwanted materials from the dockyard and was completed within the month. The second phase involves the reconstruction of the port's adjoining seabed, with the objective of accommodating larger ships. [2]
