The Africa House  is a 1999 biography by British journalist and writer  Christina Lamb . The book is subtitled  The True Story of an English Gentleman and His African Dream , and was published in London in 1999 by Viking Penguin.

The Africa House  is an account of the life of soldier, pioneer white settler, politician and supporter of African independence  Stewart Gore-Browne  in relation to the building of his estate  Shiwa Ngandu  in  Northern Rhodesia , now  Zambia . [1]  Originating with a chance encounter in 1996 with Gore-Browne's grandson in  Lusaka , the book uses Gore-Browne's diaries, letters, personal papers and photographs as well as those of his family, and interviews with family and friends, as its sources.

Critical reception for  The Africa House  was mixed to positive. [2]  The  Seattle Times  praised  The Africa House , calling it "a stunning description of a time, a place, a man and two countries' politics." [3]  The Independent called the book a "marvellous story" but criticized Lamb for "the maddening device of putting feelings into people's minds" as well as stating that many of the pictures were "printed too small to be easily identifiable". [4]   Kirkus Reviews  wrote that the book was "A cautionary but sympathetic story of a man obsessed, though less perniciously than most". [5]  In an article for the  New Statesman   Graham Boynton  positively reviewed  Africa House , writing that it "is an important book, since not only does it tell the story of an extraordinary character but it also helps explain the place of the white man in Africa." [6]

Publishers Weekly  gave a mixed review for  The Africa House , saying the book was "engaging and well crafted, although Lamb's attempts at dramatizing her subjects' emotional lives sometimes read like a romance novel, and her narrow focus on the house's history obscures the wider context of waning British empire".
