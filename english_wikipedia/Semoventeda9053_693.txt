The  Semovente da 90/53  was a heavy  Italian   self-propelled gun  and  tank destroyer , used by the Italian and German Armies during  World War II .

The Semovente da 90/53 was created by mounting a 90 mm  Cannone da 90/53   anti-aircraft gun  on top of an enlarged chassis of a  M14/41 tank . Only 30 of these vehicles were produced, all in 1942. [1]  This low production was due to Italy's limited industrial capability at the time, as well as high demand for the 90 mm gun for regular anti-aircraft duties.

The Semovente da 90/53 was primarily developed in response to demands by  Italian forces  on the  Eastern Front  for a vehicle-mounted anti-tank weapon that could take on Soviet  T-34  and  KV tanks . Italian armoured forces on the Eastern Front were equipped only with the  L6/40  tank and  Semovente 47/32  self-propelled gun; neither of these had the firepower to cope with the Soviet medium and heavy tanks. However, no Semoventi da 90/53 were ever sent to the Eastern Front.

The major drawback of the Semovente da 90/53, as with many self-propelled gun types of World War II, was the open top and rear of the gun compartment, which left the gun crew exposed to shrapnel and small arms fire. In addition, the Semovente da 90/53 had little or no armour in most areas. Because these vehicles were designed to operate far enough away from enemy vehicles to not be subject to incoming fire, this was initially not considered a problem. The small ammunition capacity of the vehicle—six rounds—was also a problem, necessitating the creation of special ammunition carriers out of  Fiat L6/40  tanks, one accompanying each Semovente da 90/53 in the field. The L6 ammunition carrier carried 26 rounds, plus an additional 40 rounds in a towed trailer. [2]  It fired  Effetto Pronto , or  HEAT  rounds, which could pierce 200mm armour plating at a range of 2,200 meters.

None were ever sent to the Eastern Front. In the  North African Campaign , the Semovente da 90/53 proved to be an effective weapon and its long range was well suited to the flat and open desert terrain. [2]  24 Semovente 90/53s saw service against the Allies in the 10° Ragruppamento Semoventi, which was stationed in Sicily during the  Allied invasion in 1943 . Following the  Armistice of Cassibile  in September 1943, the few surviving Semoventi da 90/53 were seized by the German Army, but were of little value in the mountainous terrain of Northern Italy where they operated. As a result, most finished their careers as long-range artillery.

Only one Semovente da 90/53 survived the war. Originally displayed at  Aberdeen Proving Grounds  (APG), as shown in the sidebar photo above, it was transferred the Fort Sill Field Artillery Museum in  Fort Sill, Oklahoma  in 2012. It has since been restored by the Fort Sill Directorate of Logistics (DoL) paint shop and is awaiting display. This surviving example has, " a fairly good history. It was assigned to the 163rd Support Artillery Group, was captured in Sicily in 1943 and shipped back to Aberdeen for evaluation. " [3]
