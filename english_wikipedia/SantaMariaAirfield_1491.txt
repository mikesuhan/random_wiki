Santa Maria Airfield  is an abandoned  World War II  military airfield in  Italy , located in the Cappella Santa Maria Del Carmine area of  Naples , about 23 km southeast from the main  Naples Airport .

It was an all-weather temporary field built by the XII Engineer Command using a graded earth compacted surface, with a prefabricated hessian (burlap) surfacing known as PHS. PHS was made of an asphalt-impregnated jute which was rolled out over the compacted surface over a square mesh track (SMT) grid of wire joined in 3-inch squares.  Pierced Steel Planking  was also used for parking areas, as well as for dispersal sites, when it was available. In addition, tents were used for billeting and also for support facilities; an access road was built to the existing road infrastructure; a dump for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums, along with a drinkable water and minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting.

Once completed it was turned over for use by  Twelfth Air Force  during the  Italian Campaign . Known units assigned were:

There are no remaining traces of the airfield as the urban growth of the Cappella Santa Maria Del Carmine area of Naples has expanded over the area, and obliterated any trace of the airfield. It is unknown precisely where the airfield was actually located due to the changed landscape over the past 60 years.
