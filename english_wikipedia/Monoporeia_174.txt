Pontoporeia affinis   Lindström, 1855

Monoporeia affinis , formerly referred to as  Pontoporeia affinis  ( Greek :  Πόντος ,  póntos  =  Pontus  / Black Sea;  πορεία ,  poreía  = to travel), is a small, yellowish  benthic   amphipod  living in the  Baltic Sea , the  Arctic Sea  and the lakes of the  Nordic Countries .

Monoporeia affinis  measures up to 8 millimetres (0.31 in) long when fully grown, with two pairs of  antennae  and one pair of black eyes. [2]  The legs arising from the first three segments of the abdomen are expanded basally to form broad plates. [2]   Monoporeia affinis  closely resembles another benthic amphipod,  Pontoporeia femorata , which can be distinguished from  M. affinis  by its light red eyes. [2]

M. affinis  is one of the Baltic  glacial   relicts . Originally a freshwater species, it also exists in lakes.  M. affinis  lives on soft bottoms, sometimes even as densely as 10,000–20,000 but usually hundreds to thousands of individuals per square metre. [3]  The amphipod has an important role in  bioturbation  (mixing and oxidating the bottom sediment).  Monoporeia  feeds on  phytoplankton  and decomposed organic matter sinking onto the bottom.  M. affinis  is itself the prey of  Saduria entomon ,  Harmothoe sarsi  (a  polychaete ) and fishes such as  cod ,  herring  and the  fourhorn sculpin ,  Myoxocephalus quadricornis . [4]  The increasing loss of  oxygen  in the Baltic Sea bottoms – especially in the  Gulf of Finland  – has lately been affecting the  M. affinis  population, since its eggs and embryos are very sensitive to lack of oxygen. Thus  M. affinis  is often used as an  indicator species  of the state bodies of water. [5]

After mating in the fall and bearing over the winter, the female  M. affinis  gives birth to 20–30 offspring, which only happens once during its 2–4 year lifespan. [3]

Monoporeia affinis  was originally described in the genus  Pontoporeia  by  Gustaf Lindström  in 1855. It was moved to the new genus  Monoporeia  by  Edward L. Bousfield  in 1989, alonsgide two other species, " M. microphthalma " and " M. gurjanovae ", [6]  which are now considered  synonyms  of  M. affinis . [7]
