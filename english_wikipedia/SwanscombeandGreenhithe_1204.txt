Swanscombe and Greenhithe  is a  civil parish  in the  Borough of Dartford  in  Kent , England. The two villages which give the parish its name are both located on the south bank of the  River Thames , approximately midway between  Dartford  town and  Gravesend . At the 2011 Census the population of the civil parish was 14,128. [1]

Swanscombe  village is an ancient one. The area today is undergoing a good deal of regeneration, from industry ( cement  works at one time dominated it) to housing and lighter industrial use. Dartford Borough Council has therefore dedicated a Neighbourhood Renewal Officer to oversee its development.  Greenhithe railway station  also serves the  Bluewater  shopping centre.

In 1981 Swanscombe Parish Council was upgraded to Swanscombe and Greenhithe  Town Council , thus electing its own mayor for the first time. [2]  The parish had previously been part of  Axstane Hundred ,  Dartford Rural District  and a separate  Urban District [3]
