The  Church of St John of Beverley, Whatton  is a  parish church  in the  Church of England  in  Whatton in the Vale ,  Nottinghamshire , dedicated to  St John of Beverley . The church is  Grade II* listed  by the  Department for Culture, Media & Sport  as a particularly significant building of more than local interest. [1]

The church is medieval, dating from the 14th century, but little survived the  restorations  of 1846, 1866–67 and 1870. [2]  It consists now of a chancel rebuilt in 1846, a central tower and steeple rebuilt in 1870, and a nave with north and south aisles and north and south porches. The only remaining  Romanesque  work is the former south  transept  arch of the tower, which was moved to the north side during the 19th-century restoration. The nave is in  Early English  style. There is also a chapel dedicated to the memory of Archbishop  Thomas Cranmer , who was born and raised in  Aslockton  but worshipped here.The two corbel heads in the chapel date from about 1300 and depict King  David  and an angel. [3]

Apart from interesting architectural detail (the lower part of a now redundant  newel  staircase, the  Decorated  recess containing a statue of a former incumbent [1304–10], and a double  piscina ), there is a late 14th-century effigy of a Knight Templar in armour, another of a cross-legged knight of the early 14th century, and a tablet in memory of Thomas Cranmer, father of the archbishop, who was born in  Aslockton , then a chapelry of Whatton, in 1489. [4]

The font dates from 1662. One of the 19th-century stained-glass windows, depicting SS. Peter and John and Jesus, was designed by  Edward Burne-Jones . The peal of five bells were cast by Henry Oldfield of  Nottingham  in 1590 and 1618. [5]  An early clock was installed in 1683 by  Richard Roe . [6]  This was replaced in 1910.

The church belongs to the Cranmer Group of parishes, which consists of:
