In  biology , the  electric organ  is an organ common to all  electric fish  used for the purposes of creating an  electric field . The electric organ is derived from modified nerve or muscle tissue. [1]  The electric discharge from this organ is used for navigation, communication, defense and also sometimes for the incapacitation of prey. [2]

In the 1770s the electric organs of the torpedo and electric eel were the subject of  Royal Society  papers by Hunter, Walsh and Williamson. They appear to have influenced the thinking of  Luigi Galvani  and  Alessandro Volta  - the founders of electrophysiology and electrochemistry. [3]

In the 19th century,  Charles Darwin  discussed the electric organ in his  Origin of Species  as a likely example of  convergent evolution : "But if the electric organs had been inherited from one ancient progenitor thus provided, we might have expected that all electric fishes would have been specially related to each other…I am inclined to believe that in nearly the same way as two men have sometimes independently hit on the very same invention, so  natural selection , working for the good of each being and taking advantage of analogous variations, has sometimes modified in very nearly the same manner two parts in two organic beings". [4]

Since the 20th Century, electric organs have received extensive study, for example Lissmann's 1951 paper [5]  and his review of their function and evolution in 1958. [6]

Electric organs seem to have evolved at least six times in various  teleost  and  elasmobranch  fish. [7]

Electrocytes ,  electroplaques  or  electroplaxes  are  cells  used by electric  eels ,  rays , and other  fish  for  electrogenesis . They are flat disk-like cells. Electric eels have several thousand of these cells stacked, each producing 0.15 V. The cells function by pumping positive  sodium  and  potassium   ions  out of the cell via transport proteins powered by  adenosine triphosphate  (ATP).  Postsynaptically , electrocytes work much like  muscle cells . [ clarification needed ] [ citation needed ]  They have  nicotinic acetylcholine receptors .

These cells are used in research because of their resemblance to nerve-muscle junctions.

The stack of electrocytes has long been compared to a  voltaic pile , and may even have inspired the invention of the  battery , since the analogy was already noted by  Alessandro Volta . [3]  While the electric organ is structurally similar to a battery, its cycle of operation is more like a  Marx generator , in that the individual elements are slowly charged in  parallel , then suddenly and nearly simultaneously discharged in  series  to produce a high voltage pulse.

To discharge the electrocytes at the correct time, the electric eel uses its  pacemaker nucleus , a  nucleus  of  pacemaker neurons . When an electric eel spots its prey, the pacemaker  neurons  fire and  acetylcholine  is subsequently released from electromotor neurons to the electrocytes, resulting in an electric organ discharge.

In most fishes, electric organs are oriented to fire along the length of the body, usually lying along the length of the tail and within the fish's musculature, with smaller accessory electric organs in the head. However, there are some exceptions; in  stargazers  and in  rays  the electric organs are oriented along the dorso-ventral (up-down) axis. In the electric  torpedo ray , the organ is near the pectoral muscles and the gills (see the image). The stargazer's electric organs lie between the mouth and the eye. In the electric catfish, the organs are located just below the skin and encase most of the body like a sheath.

Electric organ discharge  ( EOD ) is the electric field generated by the organs of animals including electric fish. In some cases the electric discharge is strong and is used for protection from predators; in other cases it is weak and it is used for navigation and communication. [8]  Communicating through EODs occurs when a fish uses its own electroreceptors to sense the electric signals of a nearby fish. [9]  Electric fish navigate by detecting distortions in their electrical field by using their cutaneous electroreceptors  [10] [11] [12]
