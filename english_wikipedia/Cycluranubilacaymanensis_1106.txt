The  Lesser Caymans iguana  ( Cyclura nubila caymanensis ), also known as the  Cayman Brac iguana ,  Cayman Island brown iguana  or  Sister Isles iguana , is a  critically endangered   subspecies  of the  Cuban iguana  ( Cyclura nubila ). It is native to two islands to the south of  Cuba :  Cayman Brac  and  Little Cayman , which are also known as the Sister Isles due to their similar shapes and close proximity to each other. This subspecies is in decline due to habitat encroachment by human development and predation by feral dogs and cats. It is nearly extinct on Cayman Brac (less than 100 animals), and Little Cayman supports a population of about 1,500 animals.

The Lesser Caymans iguana,  Cyclura nubila caymanensis , is endemic to the islands of Little Cayman and Cayman Brac. It is a subspecies of  Cuban iguana . This subspecies has been introduced to Grand Cayman, where it has interbred with that island's endemic  blue iguana  ( Cyclura lewisi ). [3] [4]

The  generic  name ( Cyclura ) is derived from the  Ancient Greek   cyclos  (κύκλος) meaning "circular" and  ourá  (οὐρά) meaning "tail", after the thick-ringed tail characteristic of all  Cyclura . [5]  Its  specific  name,  nubila , is  Latin  for "gray" but in this instance is a  Latinized  form of the name of  John Edward Gray , the  British   zoologist  who first described the Cuban rock iguana as a species in 1831 as opposed to the animal's base color. [2] [6]  Its subspecific name  Caymanensis  refers to the island where it lives being a Latinized form of "Cayman".

Zoologists  Thomas Barbour  and  Gladwyn Kingsley Noble  first described the Lesser Caymans iguana as a species in 1916. [2] [6]   Chapman Grant , in a monograph published in 1940, formally described the Lesser Caymans iguana for the first time as a subspecies:  Cyclura macleayi caymanensis . [2] [3] [6]

In 1975 Albert Schwartz and Thomas established the  trinomial nomenclature ,  Cyclura nubila caymanensis  for the Lesser Cayman iguana. [3] [6]  They maintained that this lizard was a subspecies of  Cyclura nubila , commonly known as the Cuban rock iguana (the population from which it evolved and can breed with if placed together under artificial conditions). [2] [3]

The Lesser Caymans iguana,  Cyclura nubila caymanensis , is a medium to large animal with an average total length between 30 and 40 inches. [7]  Males are significantly larger than females. [8]  The Lesser Caymans iguana has a skin color from light grey to green when mature, with a light blue or reddish-pink colored head, whereas females are more olive green, lacking any red or blue. [8]  Young animals tend to be uniformly dark brown or green with faint dark bands. [8]  Their distinctive black feet stand in contrast to the rest of their lighter overall body color. [8]  Their eye-color is typically brown to blood red. An individual of this subspecies has been recorded as one of the longest lived of all species and subspecies of the genus  Cyclura  at 33 years. [9]

This species, like other species of  Cyclura , is  sexually dimorphic ; males are larger than females, and have more prominent  dorsal  crests as well as larger  femoral pores  on their thighs, which are used to release  pheromones . [7] [8] [10] [11]

Native to the islands of Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, this subspecies has been introduced to Grand Cayman. [3] [4]

Like other members of the Genus  Cyclura  the Lesser Caymans iguana requires suitable areas in which to bask, forage, nest, and hide. [2]  On Little Cayman these requirements are met in a variety of interior habitats even though the iguanas are widely dispersed. [2] [12]

An ongoing population survey on Cayman Brac in 2012 has counted and pit-tagged 86 individuals. One of these was killed by a vehicle in April 2012. There are additional individuals which have been spotted but not yet captured and pit-tagged.

Like all  Cyclura  species the Lesser Caymans iguana is primarily  herbivorous , consuming leaves, flowers and fruits from over 100 different plant species. [2] [7]  This diet is very rarely, if ever supplemented with animal matter. [2] [7]

Mating occurs in April to May depending when the dry season ends, and 7-25 eggs are usually laid in May or June depending on the size and age of the female. [2]  Due to being forced to dwell inland where the soil is rocky, the females often have to migrate to coastal areas in order to build their nests in the sand. [2] [13]  The hatchlings emerge from the nests in August to early September. [2]

The Lesser Caymans iguana is critically endangered according to the current  IUCN Red List endangered species . [2]  The subspecies is vital to its native ecosystem as a seed disperser for native vegetation, and its extinction could have serious consequences as many of Little Cayman's and Cayman Brac's plants are not found elsewhere. [14]

Habitat destruction is the main factor threatening the future of this iguana. [2] [12]  The iguanas nest in the sand of beaches that are a prime  real-estate  location on Little Cayman. [8] [12]

Predation and injury to hatchlings by rats, to hatchlings and sub-adults by semi-domestic and  feral cats , and killing of adults by  roaming dogs  are all placing severe pressure on the remaining wild population on both islands. [2]

Sister Island iguanas are all too frequently killed by vehicles.

A formal captive breeding program does not exist for this subspecies but it may be warranted for the Cayman Brac population. [15]  As the population on Cayman Brac has not been found to be genetically distinct from the Little Cayman population; genetic diversity may be introduced from the Little Cayman population if it is needed. [15]

The Lesser Caymans iguana is established in captivity, both in public and private collections. [7]  Private individuals have established these animals in captive breeding programs (both purebred and occasionally mixed with either the blue iguana, Cuban iguana, and sometimes with both) minimizing the demand for wild-caught specimens for the pet trade.
