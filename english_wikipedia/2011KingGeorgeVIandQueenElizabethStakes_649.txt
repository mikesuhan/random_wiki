The  2011 King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes  was a  horse race  held at  Ascot Racecourse  on Saturday 23 July 2011. It was the 61st  King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes .

The winner was  Lady Rothschild 's  Nathaniel , a three-year-old  bay   colt  trained at  Newmarket, Suffolk  by  John Gosden  and ridden by  William Buick . Nathaniel's victory was the first for his jockey, trainer and owner.

Before the race, Nathaniel had contested five races, bypassing the  Epsom Derby  before recording his most important success when winning the  Group Two   King Edward VII Stakes  at  Royal Ascot  in June. The 2011 King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes attracted five runners, the smallest field since 1966, and Nathaniel was the only three-year-old to take part. The other contenders were  Workforce  ( Epsom Derby ,  Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe ),  Rewilding  ( Dubai Sheema Classic ,  Prince of Wales's Stakes ),  St Nicholas Abbey  ( Racing Post Trophy ,  Coronation Cup ) and  Debussy  ( Arlington Million ). Starting the 11/2 fourth choice in the betting, Nathaniel took an early lead before settling in second place behind Debussy. He moved up to regain the lead two furlongs from the finish at which point Rewilding fell heavily and was fatally injured. Workforce then emerged as Nathaniel's main challenger, but the Derby winner veered to the left in the closing stages and the three-year-old won by two and three-quarter lengths, with St Nicholas Abbey in third place.
