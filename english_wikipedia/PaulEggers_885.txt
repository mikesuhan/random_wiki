Paul Walter Eggers  (April 20, 1919 – June 21, 2013) [1]  was an  Indiana  native who was the  Republican   nominee  for  governor  of  Texas  in both 1968 and 1970, when the state still had two-year  gubernatorial  terms. (Under a 1972 state constitutional amendment, the terms were doubled in 1974 to the current four years.) Eggers' races for governor were his only attempts at elected office. At the time, he was a largely unknown tax  attorney  in  Wichita Falls  in  North Texas .

By 1970, Eggers had relocated from Wichita Falls to  Dallas . He was a close friend and associate of Republican  U.S. Senator   John G. Tower . Eggers' amiable personality was shown in his campaign posters, and he waged aggressive though underfunded races against the  conservative   Democratic  nominee,  Preston Smith , a  theater  owner from  Lubbock , who was the  lieutenant governor  under retiring Governor  John B. Connally, Jr.

Eggers was born to a minister, Ernest H. Eggers, and the former Ottilie W. Carre in  Seymour  in  Jackson County  in southern Indiana. He received his  Bachelor of Arts  degree in 1941 from  Valparaiso University  in  Valparaiso , Indiana, where he played  football . In 1978, Valparaiso University named him a "Distinguished Alumnus". He served in  World War II  as a  major  in the  United States Army Air Forces . [1]  He was honorably discharged in 1946 and on December 29 of that year married Frances Kramer. They had one son, Steven Paul Eggers (born 1957) of Dallas. [2]  In 1948, Eggers received his  J.D.  degree from the  University of Texas School of Law  at  Austin  and was thereafter licensed to practice in Texas. [3]  After his  divorce  from his first wife, Eggers married Virginia McMillin (born 1928) on February 23, 1974. He was in private practice and a partner in three law firms, Eggers, Sherrill, & Pace (1952–1969) in Wichita Falls and Eggers & Wylie (1977–1979), and Eggers & Greene (1979–1993), both in Dallas. Eggers was a long-term active member of the  Episcopal  Church. He was chancellor of the Diocese of Dallas from 1978 to 1992, when he was designated chancellor-emeritus. [2]

In 1967, Eggers headed a citizens group which developed plans to open the first senior citizens center in Wichita Falls for leisure activities for persons sixty years of age and older. The center, which offers dances, book reviews, lectures, and hot lunches, opened in May 1968. The project began on a three-year trial basis and became an integral part of Senior Citizens Services of North Texas. [4]  About the time that work began on the senior citizens center, Eggers was named to the board of directors of the City National Bank of Wichita Falls. [5]

To secure the 1968 party nomination, Eggers, with 65,501 votes (62.5 percent), handily defeated two challengers, John Trice (28,849) and Wallace Sisk (10,415). In 1964, Trice had been the GOP candidate for  Texas Attorney General  against the incumbent  Waggoner Carr , who two years later was the Democratic opponent of Senator Tower. The Republican primary vote for all three intraparty rivals was only 5.6 percent of the total Democratic primary turnout. [6] Time  called Eggers a "virtually unknown candidate who is unlikely to make Texas history by becoming the first Republican Governor since  Reconstruction ." [7]

Preston Smith won the 1968 nomination in a  runoff  against the  liberal   Don Yarborough  of  Houston , no relation to another Texas liberal with the same surname, U.S. Senator  Ralph W. Yarborough  of  Austin . In the  general election  of 1968, the heavily favored Smith received 1,662,019 ballots (57 percent) to Eggers' 1,254,333 votes (43 percent). [6]

Eggers was considered somewhat moderate for a Texas Republican candidate. He seemed to vacillate on whether to seek the support of disenchanted liberal Democrats who opposed Smith's rather conservative positions or to maintain the active goodwill of the strong conservative base within the Texas  GOP . In the end, Eggers lost, and  Vice President   Hubert H. Humphrey  of  Minnesota , with the support of retiring  U.S. President   Lyndon B. Johnson  and John Connally, held Texas, his sole Southern state, in his national loss to  Richard M. Nixon . [8]

In 1970, Eggers again ran for the Republican nomination to the Texas governorship, having defeated Roger Martin 101,875 to 7,146 votes. In the general election, he ran against Smith, who won the Democratic nomination without opposition. [6]  President Nixon came to  East Texas  in an attempt to convince conservative Democrats to support the Republican ticket. In  Longview , the seat of  Gregg County , he formally endorsed both Eggers and U.S. Senate nominee  George H.W. Bush , with his greater comments reserved for Bush, then a  U.S. Representative  from Houston.

Nixon declared his endorsement of Eggers: "I happen to know him personally and like him ... I appointed him as the General Counsel for the  Treasury Department . He rendered distinguished service. And there he learned what it means to handle the great problems involving the finance of the United States of America. He is a man who, in state government, will know how important it is to keep down that spending so that you can keep down your taxes. That is the kind of a man you want in the governor's office in Austin. He is a man who understands the other problems of government, one who will take a firm stand for the enforcement of the law in a fair way; one who will be firm for equality of opportunity for all people, and, above everything else, who will be for progress for this state." [9]

Nixon also addressed the use of school busing as a tool to promote  desegregation  of  public schools . Nixon said: "If you are going to have quality education for a child, and particularly for a young child, you will have it best by having that child go to school closest to home in his own neighborhood and not some place else. That is why George Bush, John Tower, I, and Paul Eggers all stand firmly for the neighborhood school and against busing, which the law does not require solely for the purpose of racial balance. Because that is quality education." [9]

In a low-turnout general election in 1970, Smith received 1,197,726 votes (53.6 percent) to Eggers' 1,037,723 (46.4 percent). [6]

In 1970, Eggers registered one of the stronger Republican gubernatorial showings. Eight years earlier, in the 1962 Republican race against then Democrat John Connally, the Houston  oilman   Jack Cox , a former Democrat, ran nearly as well as Eggers in 1970. Eggers ultimately finished with about the same 46 percent margin as his ticket-mate, George H. W. Bush, who lost to Democratic former U.S. Representative  Lloyd M. Bentsen, Jr. , also of Houston. Eggers trailed Bush by 34,000 votes. [10] [11]  In 1964, Bush had also fallen short in the U.S. Senate race against Democrat Ralph Yarborough. In the 1970 campaign, Bush defended his support in Congress for the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , which forbade discrimination in the sale and rental of most housing in the United States. Eggers recalls Bush's admonition to opponents of open housing in that campaign: "If you don't want to vote for me because of open housing, then don't vote for me." [12]

John Tower in  Consequences: A Personal and Political Memoir  recalled that Lloyd Bentsen "moved to the right" and cut into Bush's natural base. Eggers, Tower said, "was nickeled and dimed to death in the cow counties by Preston Smith, who ran well in the traditionally Democratic rural areas." [13]

In 1969, between his two gubernatorial races, as Nixon had mentioned in Longview, Eggers served briefly in the Treasury Department. [14]

In 1976, Eggers led a slate of delegates in  Texas's 5th congressional district  pledged to U.S. President  Gerald R. Ford, Jr. , but he lost his race and hence his delegate slot, 5,203 to 11,975 to backers of Ford's ultimately unsuccessful intraparty challenger, former  Governor   Ronald W. Reagan  of  California . Similarly,  Robert Mosbacher  in the  Houston -based  7th congressional district  lost his slot to Reagan backer  Walter Mengden , a member of the  Texas State Senate . [15]

In August 1983, Tower flew to Austin on a private plane, with Eggers among his entourage on board, to announce that he would not seek a fifth term in 1984. [16]  When Tower left office early in 1985, Eggers joined him in the formation of a consulting firm. In 1997, six years after Tower's death, Eggers, then seventy-eight, and three others were charged with defrauding investors in a scheme involving "nonexistent bank obligations", according to  Mary Jo White , then the  United States Attorney  for the  Southern District of New York . The four were charged with  conspiracy  to commit  wire fraud . [14]  The complaint filed in United States  Magistrates Court  in  Manhattan  cited a brochure entitled  Secured High-Yield Investment Program , which claimed that a $500,000 investment would bring a return of $10,390,625 within 60 days. [14]

The  Federal Bureau of Prisons  shows no record of Eggers having been imprisoned as a result of the charges filed against him in 1997. [17]

From 1987 to 1990, Eggers was named by Republican Governor  Bill Clements  as chairman of the Governor's Task Force on Drug Abuse. [2]

Though he did not seek office after 1970, Eggers supported various Republican candidates over the years, including the unsuccessful campaigns of  Thomas Pauken  for the  U.S. House  in Dallas and  Howard Callaway  for the U.S. Senate in  Colorado , both in 1980. Callaway had been President  Gerald R. Ford 's first campaign manager in 1975. Eggers donated to the pre-general election race of the  Reagan -Bush ticket in 1984 and to U.S. Representative  Phil Gramm , Tower's successor in the U.S. Senate. In the summer of 1995, Eggers donated to the short-lived presidential bid of then  Governor   Pete Wilson  of  California . He also contributed to the  Texas Republican Party  in Austin. [18] [19]

Until his death, Paul and Virginia Eggers resided in Dallas, [20]  where he had been a member of the Brook Hollow Golf Club. [2]

Eggers and his  identical twin  brother, Arthur Eggers, received the Silver Anniversary All American Award in 1966 from  Sports Illustrated  magazine in recognition of "extraordinary achievement" in the twenty-five years since playing their last college football game. He also had a second brother, the Reverend Ernest Eggers, and three sisters. [1]
