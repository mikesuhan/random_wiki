Ctesibius  is a small  lunar   impact crater  that is located near the  equator , on the  far side  of the  Moon  and is named after  Ctesibius . It lies between the larger crater  Abul WÃ¡fa  to the west and the slightly smaller  Heron  to the east.

The outer wall of Ctesibius is wide and sharp-edged, with little erosion. A low ridge is attached to the southern rim, and curves to the south-southeast. At the center of the relatively flat interior is a low ridge. Faint traces of  ray material  lies across the western floor and rim from  Necho  to the southeast.
