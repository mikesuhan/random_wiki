Standing Army , directed by Enrico Parenti and Thomas Fazi, is a 2010 documentary film about the global network of U.S. military bases, the impact that these have on local populations, and the military-industrial complex that lies behind it.

The  United States  has 250,000 soldiers stationed on more than 700  military bases  in at least 40 countries across the globe,. [1] [2]  This deployment has continued to increase. [3] [4]

The film explores historical  displacement of native populations , including Italy, on  Diego Garcia  (an Indian Ocean island) and the Middle East. [5]  The film posits that while the traditional definition of the term  empire  means possession of  colonies , the foundation of an " American empire " is based on a worldwide network of military bases. While they used to serve as simple supply facilities in war-like conflicts, they are often formed in the aftermath of armed US interventions, raising the question if this is intentional strategy. [6]  The film presents various data and concludes with  Chalmers Johnson , former  CIA  advisor, who claims this is a new type of  imperialism  containing a self-destructive recoil force that will lead to a medium-term decline and the ruin of the American position of power in the world.
