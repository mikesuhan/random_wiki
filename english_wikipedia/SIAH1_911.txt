E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase SIAH1  is an  enzyme  that in humans is encoded by the  SIAH1   gene . [3] [4]

This gene encodes for a polypeptide structure that is a member of the seven in absentia homolog (SIAH) family. The protein is an  E3 ligase  and is involved in  ubiquitination  and  proteasome -mediated degradation of specific proteins. The activity of this ubiquitin ligase has been implicated in the development of certain forms of  Parkinson's disease , the regulation of the cellular response to  hypoxia  and induction of  apoptosis .  Alternative splicing  results in several additional transcript variants, some encoding different isoforms and others that have not been fully characterized. [5]

SIAH1 has been shown to  interact  with:
