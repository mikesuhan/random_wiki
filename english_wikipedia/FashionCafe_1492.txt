Fashion Cafe  was a restaurant based in New York City featuring celebrity models. Francesco Buti and Tommaso Buti founded the restaurant in 1995 and were arrested in Italy for fraud, bankruptcy, and money laundering in 1998. [1]  The business was initially fronted by super models  Naomi Campbell ,  Elle Macpherson ,  Claudia Schiffer , and  Christy Turlington . [2]  The  Associated Press  called the chain "a couture version of  Planet Hollywood  and the  Hard Rock Cafe ." [3]

Brothers Tommaso and Francesco Buti are each charged in New York State USA and Milan with 35 counts of wire fraud, 14 counts of stolen property transportation, 1 count of money laundering and 1 count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and to transport stolen property in interstate and foreign commerce. They could face fines and prison terms of 5 to 20 years on each count.

The chain first opened in  Rockefeller Center ,  New York City  in 1995. [1]  On Monday May 6, 1996, construction began on the  London  branch of the chain, though the London branch went bust in 1999, a year after it opened. [2]  The London and New York locations became the primary locations of Fashion Cafe. Fashion Cafe encountered difficulties from the beginning. Matt Haig, author of  Brand Failures , said that "The connection between models and food was not an obvious one, and 'fashion' was not a theme that made people feel hungry." [4]

Once the chain encountered difficulties, Campbell and MacPherson accused Tommaso Buti of stealing 10 000 USD a day from company's money to cover debt for his personal lavish playboy lifestyle, after asking the two to invest in the chain. Schiffer withdrew from the venture, blaming old issues with Campbell. [4]  The Rockefeller Center Fashion Cafe closed in 1998. [5]  On December 11, 2000 the  Federal Government of the United States  filed charges against the founders, accusing them of conspiracy, fraud, and money laundering. [1]
