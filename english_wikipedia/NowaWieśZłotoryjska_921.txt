Nowa Wieś Złotoryjska   [ˈnɔva ˈvjɛɕ zwɔtɔˈrɨi̯ska]  ( German :  Neudorf am Rennwege ) is a village in the administrative district of  Gmina Złotoryja , within  Złotoryja County ,  Lower Silesian Voivodeship , in south-western Poland. [1]  Prior to 1945 it was in  Germany . It lies approximately 13 kilometres (8 mi) west of  Złotoryja  and 91 km (57 mi) west of the regional capital  Wrocław .

The current name of the village refers to the old name. In 1245 it was called "New Australis" the property of the bishop in  Wrocław . There is no doubt that the title of "the nuve dorf of deme Rennewege" from 1260 and 1420 describes the current area of the village. The word "Reneweg" refers to the horse racing track. Horses have been breeding for a long time near  Złotoryja  because the flat land around the village is suitable for them. During the  Napoleonic wars , the main chief moved his headquarters to this village. In the mid-nineteenth century the village contained 45 houses and 268 inhabitants. There was also a school and a pub. Evangelicals and Catholics attended the church in Złotoryja. Currently, the village is inhabited by about 150 people. It has good conditions for developing agriculture. Seven of the manor houses and residentials are included in the Polish register of historical monuments.
