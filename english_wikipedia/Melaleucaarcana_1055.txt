Melaleuca arcana  is a small tree or large shrub in the myrtle  family ,  Myrtaceae  and is  endemic  to  Cape York Peninsula  in northern  Australia . It has papery bark and small heads of white flowers in summer.

Melaleuca arcana  grows to a height of 0.5–15 m (2–50 ft) and has whitish, papery bark. Its leaves are arranged alternately, 23–75 mm (0.9–3 in) long, 7–26 mm (0.3–1 in) wide, broadly egg-shaped with a blunt tip and with 5 to 11 parallel veins. [1]

The flowers are white or cream, sometimes pinkish and arranged in heads on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering and in the upper leaf axils. The heads are up to 18 mm (0.7 in) in diameter and contain between 5 and 11 groups of flowers in threes. The stamens are arranged in 5 bundles around the flowers and each bundle contains 6 to 9 stamens. Flowering occurs unpredictably throughout the year and is followed by fruit which are woody  capsules  2.5–4 mm (0.1–0.2 in) long, arranged in cylindrical spikes. The seeds are released within a year when the fruits are mature. [1] [2]

The species was first formally described in 1968 by  Stanley Thatcher Blake  from a specimen collected north-west of  Cooktown  and west of Cape Bedford in  Three Islands National Park . The  specific epithet  ( arcana ) is from the  Latin   arcanus , meaning "hidden", "secret" or "private" [3]  in reference to the species' apparent rarity. [1]

Melaleuca incana  occurs on the east coast of  Cape York Peninsula  in the  swales  between sand dunes. [4]

This melaleuca has the status "of least concern" in the Government of Queensland  Nature Conservation Act 1992 . [5]

This species is useful for sand stabilisation in coastal areas and it is a good source of honey. [6]

The wood can be used for posts and railway ties. [6]

In some situations this species may be preferable to  Melaleuca leucadendron  as a street tree because of its smaller size at maturity. It has been grown as far south as  Brisbane . [7]
