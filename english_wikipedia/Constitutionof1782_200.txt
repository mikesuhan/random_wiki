The  Constitution of 1782  is the series of legal changes which freed the  Parliament of Ireland , a  Medieval  parliament consisting of the  Irish House of Commons  and the  Irish House of Lords , of legal restrictions that had been imposed by successive  Norman ,  English , and later,  British  governments on the scope of its jurisdiction. These restrictions had, in effect, allowed the Irish executive of the  Lord Lieutenant of Ireland  to control the parliamentary agenda and to restrict its ability to legislate rather than promote the objectives of the monarchy.

The most punitive restrictions arose in  Poynings' Law  of 1495. These restrictions were lifted in 1782, producing a period of novel legislative freedom. This period came to be known as  Grattan's Parliament  after  Henry Grattan , a major campaigner for reform in the House of Commons and leader of the  Patriot Party .

The new constitutional arrangements proved short-lived in consequence of the  1798 uprising by the United Irishmen . By the  Acts of Union  the Parliament of Ireland was abolished, and the  Kingdom of Ireland  absorbed into the new  United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland , with effect from 1 January 1801.
