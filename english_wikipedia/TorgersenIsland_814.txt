Torgersen Island  is a small rocky island lying just east of  Litchfield Island  in the entrance to  Arthur Harbour , off the south-west coast of  Anvers Island  in the  Palmer Archipelago  of  Antarctica . It was surveyed by the  Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey  in 1955 and named by the  UK-APC  for Torstein Torgersen, first mate of the  Harbor  in late February 1955, preceding the vessel  Norsel  in one of the ship's boats and making soundings.

The island forms part of the Northern Arthur Harbour  Important Bird Area  (IBA), identified as such by  BirdLife International  because it supports significant  seabird   breeding colonies . [1]
