St Peter  and  St Paul 's Catholic Voluntary Academy  (formerly St Peter and St Paul's Catholic High School) is a  coeducational   Roman Catholic   secondary school  and  sixth form  with  academy status , situated in  Lincoln , England. It is one of only two Catholic high schools in  Lincolnshire , and the smallest secondary school in Lincoln.

The school was built in the late 1950s. When the school opened in 1959 it was very small and could only hold a limited number of pupils. Over time the school added additional buildings, and a number of different subjects were included in the  curriculum , such as  Woodwork  and  Metalwork , but these were dropped through curriculum change.

On 1 May 2013, the school announced its conversion to academy status, becoming part of the St Gilbert of Sempringham Catholic Academy Trust and being renamed as St Peter and St Paul's Catholic Voluntary Academy. [1]

The school opened within one building. Buildings were added, the first being a set of typing huts, but these were replaced with an  ICT  and Maths building called The Annex Block. Other buildings included a Science building, Sports Hall and, most recently, an English and  Performing Arts  centre. There were temporary units such as The Magdalene Centre, chiefly used for special needs and general education; it was demolished in 2008. The T Blocks, used for extra classrooms, remained after other units were demolished, but this was removed in 2011. Three years after The Magdalene Centre was demolished a new learning support centre, 'The Newman Centre', was built.

Originally there were four houses. Each was named after a saint: Bernadette, Teresa, Hugh and Francis. Teresa House was temporarily suspended in 2010 through lack of pupils.
