The  Léon Gambetta  was a French Navy  armoured cruiser  of 12,400 tons, the  lead ship  of the  class of that name . The  Gambettas  were larger than previous armoured cruisers of the class, but they lacked the heavier firepower. They also were vulnerable to underwater attacks.

She was launched on 26 October 1901 at the  Arsenal de Brest . While on steam trial in December 1903, she struck an unknown pinnacle of rock off Black Rock Islands near  Brest  in fog and suffered considerable damage. Repairs were not complete until mid-1904.

On the night of 27 April 1915, when 15 miles (24 km) south of  Santa Maria di Leuca  (the south-eastern tip of Italy in the  Ionian Sea ) in position  39°30′N   18°15′E ﻿ / ﻿ 39.500°N 18.250°E ﻿ /  39.500; 18.250 Coordinates :  39°30′N   18°15′E ﻿ / ﻿ 39.500°N 18.250°E ﻿ /  39.500; 18.250 , she was torpedoed twice by  Austro-Hungarian  submarine  U-5  under the command of  Korvettenkapitän   Georg Ludwig Ritter von Trapp  (later to be known as patriarch of the  Von Trapp Family Singers ).

Léon Gambetta  was part of the French fleet based at  Malta  blockading the Austrian Navy in the  Adriatic , usually from a position south of the  Strait of Otranto . At this time the blockade line was moved further north because of expected Austrian naval activity – the  Allies  were negotiating with the Italians which shortly led to them declaring war on Austria-Hungary. In spite of the growing threat from Austrian and now German U-boats in the Mediterranean, the  armoured cruiser  was patrolling unescorted at a reported 7 knots (13 km/h) on a clear, calm night just to the south of the Otranto Straits when she was torpedoed by the  U-5 .

Léon Gambetta  sank in just 10 minutes. Out of 821 men on board, 684 including  Rear Admiral   Victor Baptistin Senes , commander of the 2nd Light Division, were lost along with all commissioned officers. There were 137 survivors. The French cruiser patrol line was moved South to the longitude of  Cephalonia , western  Greece . Other sources place her loss 20 miles (32 km) off Cape Leuca.
