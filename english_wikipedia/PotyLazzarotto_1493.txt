Napoleon Potyguara Lazzarotto , better known as  Poty  ( Curitiba , March 29, 1924 – Curitiba, May 8, 1998) was a Brazilian artist. His  murals  - often made of ceramic  tiles  - can be seen in many localities of Brazil as well as in Portugal, France and Germany.

Nonetheless, most of Poty's works were done in his hometown: Curitiba. Therefore, the artist mosaics, spread out through the capital of  Paraná , are among the main icons of the city.
