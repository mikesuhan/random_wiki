Class of '99  was a short-term  alternative rock  supergroup consisting of members from notable rock bands:

They also had the help of  Matt Serletic  on keyboards.

These four musicians collaborated to cover  Pink Floyd 's " Another Brick in the Wall  (Part 2)" (as well as "Another Brick in the Wall (Part 1)") for the soundtrack to  Robert Rodriguez 's 1998 science-fiction horror film,  The Faculty . Contrary to rumors and popular belief, the four musicians collaborated solely to cover the songs for the film and did not create a band or intend on releasing other new material.

In 1999, a single of both versions was released on the Sony International record label. It also contained  Stabbing Westward 's "Haunting Me".

The "Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)" video was directed by Jim Shea, and aired for the first time in January 1999.
