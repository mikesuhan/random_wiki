James Miller   FRSE   FRIBA   FRIAS   RSA  (1860–1947) was a Scottish architect, recognised for his commercial architecture in  Glasgow  and for his Scottish railway stations. Notable among these are the American-influenced  Union Bank  building at 110–20 St Vincent Street; his 1901–1905 extensions to  Glasgow Central railway station ; [1]  and  Wemyss Bay railway station  on the  Firth of Clyde . [2]  His lengthy career resulted in a wide range of building types, and, with the assistance of skilled draughtsmen such as Richard M Gunn, he adapted his designs to changing tastes and new architectural materials and technologies.

Miller moved to  Stirling  in 1911, at 'Randolphfield', and died there on 28 November 1947.

James Miller was the son of a farmer, and was born in Auchtergaven, Perthshire, in 1860. [3]  He spent most of his childhood in Little Cairnie,  Forteviot , and was educated at  Perth Academy . [4]

In 1877 he was articled to the Perth architect Andrew Heiton, and on completion of his apprenticeship, he worked in  Edinburgh  at the office of  Hippolyte Blanc . [3]  before joining the engineering department of the  Caledonian Railway , initially in Perth.

In 1888, Miller was transferred to the Caledonian Railway's drawing office in Glasgow, and designed a number of railway stations in the West of Scotland under the supervision of the engineer-in-chief, George Graham, and Donald Alexander Matheson, who was to become his successor. Notable designs from this period include the English-domestic style stations at  Fort Matilda  (1889),  Troon  (1892) and  West Kilbride  (1900), and the interchanges between rail and steamer at  Gourock  Pier (1889) and  Greenock Princes Pier  (1893). In 1892, having won the competition to design Belmont Church in  Hillhead , he set up in full-time practice on his own account and rented an office at 223 West George Street, Glasgow. He continued to design for the Caledonian and other Scottish railway companies, including the distinctive 'chalet style' stations on the  West Highland Railway  in 1894, and the Scottish  Jacobean -style  St Enoch subway station  for the  Glasgow District Subway Company .

During the following 40 years, he won competitions and commissions for a wide variety of buildings including for the 1901  Glasgow International Exhibition , of which his Sunlight Cottages are the sole remains; in 1901 for the  Glasgow Royal Infirmary , which resulted in a bulky and unpopular  baronial-style  design; and in 1904 for the  Glasgow & South Western Railway 's  Turnberry Hotel . He undertook significant work for the Caledonian Railway at this time, including extensions to Glasgow Central Station and its  hotel  (1900–1905), and Wemyss Bay railway station (1903), with its circular booking office and curving timber walkway to the steamer pier. He also designed the Govan memorial church to  Margaret Macgregor . [5]

In 1910 he won the competition to design the headquarters of the  Institution of Civil Engineers  at  One Great George Street  in London's  Westminster , together with the adjacent matching extension to the  Institution of Mechanical Engineers , which were built of  Portland stone  in a  neo-Baroque  style.

An American influence began to appear in Miller's work following a 1902 fact-finding visit to the USA by Matheson. An early example was Olympic House (1903), a plain rectangular speculative office development in Glasgow's Queen Street, followed by the  Anchor Line  Building (1905–07) on St Vincent Place. The façade of this building is of white  faience  tiles, the first time that a Scottish architect had used this material. [6]  It developed further following the appointment in 1918 of Richard M Gunn as chief draughtsman and designer, which resulted in designs such as the McLaren warehouse (1922) in George Square, and the massive classical Head Office for the Union Bank of Scotland (1924) in St Vincent Street.

Miller's later commercial architecture during the 1930s featured hints of  Egyptian revival  decoration and  Art Deco , as seen in the  Commercial Bank of Scotland  (1930–1) at the corner of Glasgow's West Nile and West George streets; and the last of his bank buildings, also for the Commercial Bank of Scotland, at 30 Bothwell Street (1934–35). Both these buildings used white Portland Stone to combat the effects of Glasgow's polluted atmosphere at the time.

Major commissions beyond Scotland included  Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys  (1927) in  Leicester , and the  neo-Georgian  style Dining Hall and 'Cocoa Block' (1929) for  Cadbury  at  Bournville . His final designs were for long, low buildings such as the Glasgow & West of Scotland College of Commerce (1933) in Pitt Street, Glasgow.

Miller's domestic work spanned his architectural career. Much of his early work, such as 'Dunloskin',  Dumbreck  (1890), and Craighuchty Terrace,  Aberfoyle  (c.1890) is in an English  Arts & Crafts  style and influenced by his railway architecture. Further commissions for houses in Glasgow followed as a result of Miller's involvement in the 1901 Glasgow International Exhibition, including 8 and 10 Lowther Terrace, Great Western Road (1904 and 1910 respectively). Between 1915 and 1923, he designed 'Kildonan', near  Barrhill , Ayrshire, for  Captain David Euan Wallace MP , a very large property similar in size to Turnberry Hotel, and in a  Tudor Revival  style.

Miller died on 28 November 1947 at Randolphield,  Stirling , which had been his home since 1911. His son George, one of three children, had joined the practice in the mid-1930s but died in 1940, at which point James retired.
