Apocrypta  is an  Old World  genus of parasitic  fig  wasps in the family  Pteromalidae . They are  parasitoids  of gall-wasps in the  Sycophagini  tribe, and especially  Ceratosolen  species, pollinators of the  Sycomorus ,  Sycocarpus  and  Neomorphe  sections of  Ficus . [1]  They seem to be fig species-specific. [1]

They parasitize certain species of the fig wasp genera  Apocryptophagus  and  Ceratosolen . [2]  The long ovipositor is pierced through the fig wall to infect the fig wasp larvae during their development inside the flower  galls . [3]  Penetration of the syconium wall may last from 6 to 55 minutes, [1]  depending on the wasp and fig species.

Ceratosolen  wasps are key pollinator species, and their production is consequently reduced. [4]   Apocryptophagus  wasps are however gall forming non-pollinators. Some differences in  Apocrypta  behaviour and morphology reflect the variety in fig inflorescence morphology. [1]

The adult female has an elongate external ovipositor, some 2 to 5Â mm long, which reflects the thickness of the syconium wall of the host fig species. To stabilize the long ovipositor during oviposition, the proximal gastral segments can telescope outwards as the abdomen is lifted up, which in some species leans forward beyond the head. [1]  The ovipositor is enclosed and guided by a flexible ovipositor sheath. As in several genera of parasitic wasp, the highly flexible sheath supports the ovipositor's tip during the initial stages of oviposition. [1] [5]

There are some 27 described species which include: [2]

Female ovipositing, showing flexible (bent) ovipositor sheath

Ovipositor protruding from tip of the flexible ovipositor sheath

Females congregating on a young fig
