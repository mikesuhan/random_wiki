WhatsNew Group  is a  Thailand  based e-commerce company that is parent to multiple e-commerce brands that include  Petloft  (pet care),  Venbi  (mom & baby),  Sanoga  (health),  Lafema  (beauty) and  MOXY  (women's fashion). The company leverages technology and the  Internet  to make home life and  online shopping  easier for people in Southeast Asia. Headquartered in Bangkok, WhatsNew Group sells both international and local brands under each e-commerce vertical. It is one of the portfolio companies of  Ardent Capital , a  venture capitalist  based in Thailand. As of January 2016, the company merged with Bilna, Indonesia's e-commerce platform for mothers and announced a regional rebrand to the name Orami. [1]

The company was seed funded by Ardent Capital in early 2013 [2]  and was modelled after  Quidsi, Inc.  in the US following its acquisition by  Amazon  for $550 million on November 8, 2010. [3]  Petloft was the first company built by WhatsNew co-founders Harprem Doowa and Sarah Huang, who are no longer with the company and have their new business. [4]  The company later built Venbi and Lafema to serve their growing female customer base and acquired Sanoga within a year. In December 2014, WhatsNew Group acquired ilovemoxy, [5]  an online lifestyle shop started by Shannon Kalayanamitr, a serial entrepreneur based in Bangkok who later joined WhatsNew Group as their Chief Marketing Officer.

The company was reported by Tech in Asia as a Thai startup launching to compete directly against  Rocket Internet [6]  in the Southeast Asian e-commerce market. [7]

WhatsNew Group announced mid-2015 that they would be expanding to  Indonesia  under the new name MOXY. [8]  The company's decision to consolidate their e-commerce verticals under one brand was based on their large female customer base, the growing female economy and focus on creating a strong brand. In a series of moves to expand regionally, Jérémy Fichet, the former Co-founder and Managing Director of  Cdiscount  was officiated as the company's new Group CEO. [9]

MOXY Indonesia  is Southeast Asia's first business-to-consumer women-focused e-commerce platform. The online destination offers products catered specifically to the country's female demographic and totes the tagline, "Have it all". To service the unique e-commerce infrastructure in Southeast Asia, [10]  MOXY provides  cash on delivery , among other methods of payment, in over 250 cities across Indonesia.

On February 24th 2016, MoxyBilna announced $15 million in funding from Facebook Inc. co-founder Eduardo Saverin, Sinar Mas Group, Shanghai-based Gobi Partners Inc., Velos Partners and Ardent Capital LLC. [11]  The company has begun their transition to the name Orami in order to unify their brand regionally. The rebrand will be complete by Q3 of 2016. [12]
