Paul Lane Penn  (1939/40 – 10 May 2014) was a New Zealand  rugby union  player, coach and administrator. A  wing , Penn played for  Taranaki  and  Wairarapa  at provincial level, and later became coach of  Wairarapa-Bush . He was an  All Black  selector from 1988 to 1991, and served as president of the  New Zealand Rugby Football Union  from 2001 to 2003.

Penn was born in  Stratford, New Zealand , and was educated at  New Plymouth Boys' High School . He made his debut for Taranaki while still at school, and went on to play more than 50 games for the province — including 10  Ranfurly Shield  matches, and internationals against France and Australia — between 1957 and 1963. [1] [2]  After moving to the  Wairarapa , Penn joined the Gladstone club and played 12 games for the provincial side there between 1965 and 1966. [1]

Penn later became coach of the Gladstone senior team, and after taking them to a club championship, succeeded  Brian Lochore  as coach of Wairarapa-Bush in 1983. He coached the provincial side for four years, during which time they maintained their first-division status, finishing as high as fourth in the 1985 season. [1]

In 1988 Penn was appointed as an All Black selector, once again taking over from Lochore, and served in that role until 1991. During that time Penn coached the New Zealand development team, New Zealand Marist and the New Zealand under-19 side. As a coach of national teams, Penn was undefeated. He also served as an assistant to All Blacks coach  Alex Wyllie  and was a member of the selection panel which chose  John Hart  as All Blacks coach. [1]

Penn was elected vice-president of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union in 1999 and succeeded  Andy Dalton  as president in 2001. [1] [3]  His two-year term was characterized by his strong advocacy for grassroots and provincial rugby in New Zealand. [4] [5]

Outside of rugby, Penn was a farmer at  Opaki , near Masterton. [6]  He died at Wairarapa Hospital on 10 May 2014, following a  stroke  suffered while working on the farm two days earlier. [7]
