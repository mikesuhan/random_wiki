In  four-dimensional   Euclidean geometry , the  steriruncic tesseractic honeycomb  is a uniform space-filling  tessellation  (or  honeycomb ) in Euclidean 4-space.

The [4,3,3 1,1 ],  ,  Coxeter group  generates 31 permutations of uniform tessellations, 23 with distinct symmetry and 4 with distinct geometry. There are two alternated forms: the alternations (19) and (24) have the same geometry as the  16-cell honeycomb  and  snub 24-cell honeycomb  respectively.
