The  graphics display resolution  is the width and height dimensions of an  electronic visual display  device, such as a  computer monitor , in  pixels . Certain combinations of width and height are standardized and typically given a name and an  initialism  that is descriptive of its dimensions. A higher display resolution in a display of the same size means that displayed content appears  sharper .

The favored aspect ratio of mass market display industry products has changed gradually from 4:3, then to 16:10, and then to 16:9, and now 21:9. [ original research? ]  The 4:3 aspect ratio generally reflects older products, especially the era of the cathode ray tube (CRT). The 16:10 aspect ratio had its largest use in the 1995–2010 period, and the 16:9 aspect ratio tends to reflect post-2010 mass market computer monitor, laptop, and entertainment products displays.

The 4:3 aspect ratio was common in older television cathode ray tube (CRT) displays, which were not easily adaptable to a wider aspect ratio. When good quality alternate technologies (i.e., liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and plasma displays) became more available and less costly, around the year 2000, the common computer displays and entertainment products moved to a wider aspect ratio, first to the 16:10 ratio. The 16:10 ratio allowed some compromise between showing older 4:3 aspect ratio broadcast TV shows, but also allowing better viewing of widescreen movies. However, around the year 2005, entertainment industry displays (i.e., TV sets) gradually moved from 16:10 to the 16:9 aspect ratio, for further improvement of viewing widescreen movies. By about 2007, virtually all mass market entertainment displays were 16:9. In 2011, 1920×1080 (Full HD, the native resolution of Blu-ray) was the favored resolution in the most heavily marketed entertainment market displays. The next standard, 3840×2160 (4K UHD) emerged on the market in 2013.

Also in 2013, displays with 2560×1080 (aspect ratio 64:27 or 2. 370 , however commonly referred to as "21:9" for easy comparison with 16:9) appeared, which closely approximate the common  CinemaScope  movie standard aspect ratio of 2.35–2.40. In 2014, "21:9" screens with pixel dimensions of 3440×1440 (actual aspect ratio 43:18 or 2.3 9 ) became available as well.

The computer display industry maintained the 16:10 aspect ratio longer than the entertainment industry, but in the 2005–2010 period, computers were increasingly marketed as dual use products, with uses in the traditional computer applications, but also as means of viewing entertainment content. In this time frame, with the notable exception of Apple, almost all desktop, laptop, and display manufacturers gradually moved to promoting only 16:9 aspect ratio displays. By 2011, the 16:10 aspect ratio had virtually disappeared from the Windows laptop display market (although Macintosh laptops are still mostly 16:10, including the 2880×1800 15" Retina MacBook Pro and the 2560×1600 13" Retina MacBook Pro). One consequence of this transition was that the highest available resolutions moved generally downward (i.e., the move from 1920×1200 laptop displays to 1920×1080 displays).

nHD  is a display resolution of 640×360 pixels, which is exactly one ninth of a  Full HD  (1080p) frame and one quarter of a  HD  (720p) frame. Pixel doubling (vertically and horizontally) nHD frames will form one 720p frame and pixel tripling nHD frames will form one 1080p frame.

One drawback of this resolution is that the vertical resolution is not an even multiple of 16, which is a common  macroblock  size for  video codecs . Video frames encoded with 16×16 pixel macroblocks would be padded to 640×368 and the added pixels would be cropped away at playback. H.264 codecs have this padding and cropping ability built-in as standard. The same is true for qHD and 1080p but the relative amount of padding is more for lower resolutions such as nHD.

To avoid storing the eight lines of padded pixels, some people prefer to encode video at 624×352, which only has one stored padded line. When such video streams are either encoded from HD frames or played back on HD displays in full screen mode (either 720p or 1080p) they are scaled by non-integer scale factors. True nHD frames on the other hand has integer scale factors, for example Nokia 808 PureView with nHD display.

qHD  is a display resolution of 960×540 pixels, which is exactly one quarter of a  Full HD  (1080p) frame, in a 16:9  aspect ratio .

Similar to DVGA, this resolution became popular for high-end smartphone displays in early 2011. Mobile phones including the  Jolla ,  Sony Xperia C ,  HTC Sensation ,  Motorola Droid RAZR ,  LG Optimus L9 ,  Microsoft Lumia 535  and  Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini  have displays with the qHD resolution, as does the  PlayStation Vita  portable game system.

The  HD  resolution of 1280×720 pixels stems from  high-definition television  (HDTV), where it originally used 60 frames per second. With its 16:9 aspect ratio it is exactly 2 times the width and 1½ times the height of 4:3  VGA , which shares its aspect ratio and 480 line count with  NTSC . HD therefore has exactly 3 times as many pixels as VGA.

This resolution is often referred to as  720p , although the  p  (which stands for  progressive scan  and is important for transmission formats) is irrelevant for labeling digital display resolutions.

In the mid 2000s, when the digital HD technology and standard debut the market, this type of resolution was very often and commonly referred to (both by the public and by the marketers) by its friendlier branded and certified name  HD ready . [ citation needed ]

Few screens have been built that actually use this resolution natively, most employ 16:9 panels with 768 lines instead ( WXGA ), which resulted in odd numbers of pixels per line, i.e. 1365⅓ are rounded to 1360, 1364, 1366 or even 1376, the next multiple of 16.

The  HD+  resolution of 1600×900 pixels in a 16:9 aspect ratio is often referred to as  900p .

The  FHD  or  Full HD  resolution of 1920×1080 pixels in a 16:9 aspect ratio was developed as an HDTV transmission and storage format. Using  interlacing , the bandwidth requirements are very similar to those of  720p  – their pixel counts are roughly in a 2:1 ratio, 9:4 exactly. FHD is 3 times the width and    2   1 ⁄ 4  times the height of 4:3  VGA . This resolution is often referred to as  1080p  (although screens that use  interlacing  instead of progressive scan are more accurately referred to as  1080i ).

The  Full HD+  is a resolution of 2160×1440 pixels in a 3:2 aspect. It has double-sized of Full HD or 1440×1080 pixels and doubles the width of 1080 pixels.

The first products announced to use this resolution were the  Surface Pro 3 .  Samsung Galaxy TabPro S  was announced using this resolution in 2016.

DCI 2K , also referred to as  Cinema 2K , [ citation needed ]  was established by the  Digital Cinema Initiatives  consortium in 2005 and defines a resolution of  2048×1080  (2.2 megapixels) with an aspect ratio of ~19:10 for 2K film projection. [1]  This is the native resolution for DCI-compliant 2K digital projectors and displays.

QHD  ( Quad HD ),  WQHD  ( Wide Quad HD ), [2]  or  1440p , [3]  is a display resolution of 2560×1440 pixels in a 16:9  aspect ratio . The name  QHD  reflects the fact that it has four times as many pixels as  HD  (720p). It is also commonly called  WQHD , to emphasize it being a wide resolution, although that is technically unnecessary, since the HD resolutions are all wide. One advantage of using "WQHD" is avoiding confusion with qHD with a small q (960×540).

This resolution was under consideration by the ATSC in the late 1980s to become the standard HDTV format, because it is exactly 4 times the width and 3 times the height of VGA, which has the same number of lines as NTSC signals at the  SDTV  4:3 aspect ratio. Pragmatic technical constraints made them choose the now well-known 16:9 formats with twice (HD) and thrice (FHD) the VGA width instead.

In October 2006,  Chi Mei Optoelectronics  (CMO) announced a 47 inch 1440p LCD panel to be released in Q2 2007; [4]  the panel was planned to finally debut at FPD International 2008 in a form of  autostereoscopic   3D display . [5]  As of the end of 2013, monitors with this resolution are becoming more common. A  list of monitors with QHD resolution  is available.

The resolution is also used in portable devices. In September 2012, Samsung announced the Series 9 WQHD laptop with a 13 inch 2560×1440 display. [6]  In August 2013, LG announced a 5.5 inch QHD smartphone display, which was used in the  LG G3 . [7]  In October 2013 Vivo announced a smartphone with a 2560×1440 display. [8]   Other phone manufacturers followed in 2014, such as Samsung with the  Galaxy Note 4 , [9]  and  Google [10]  and  Motorola [11]  with the  Nexus 6 [12]  smartphone. By the mid 2010s, it was a common resolution among flagship phones such as the  HTC 10 , the  Lumia 950  and the  Galaxy S6 . [13]

WQXGA+  ( Wide Quad Extended Graphics Array Plus ), also referred to as  QHD [14]  and  QHD+ , [15]  is a resolution of 3200×1800 in a 16:9 aspect ratio. It has four times as many pixels as the 1600×900 HD+ resolution.

The first products announced to use this resolution were the 2013  HP Envy  14 TouchSmart Ultrabook [16]  and the 13.3 in  Samsung Ativ Q . [17]

UWQHD  ( Ultra-Wide Quad HD ), is a display resolution of 3440×1440 pixels in a 43:18  aspect ratio  (2.3 9 :1, or 21.5:9). The first monitor to support this resolution was the 34-inch LG 34UM95-P. [18]  LG uses the term "UW-QHD" to describe this resolution. This monitor was first released in Germany in late December 2013, before being officially announced at CES 2014.

UW4K  ( Ultra-Wide 4K ), is a display resolution of 3840×1600 pixels in a 12:5 aspect ratio (2.4:1, or 21.6:9). This resolution is commonly used on Ultra HD Blu-ray discs. The first monitor to support this resolution was the 37.5-inch LG 38UC99-W.

4K UHD  ( Ultra HD ), also referred to as  UHDTV-1  or  4K × 2K , is a display resolution of 3840×2160 pixels (four times as many pixels as FHD) in the same 16:9  aspect ratio . [19] [20]  This resolution is defined in the  UHDTV  standard as "4K UHD", but prior to the publication of the standard it was sometimes casually referred to as "QFHD" (Quad Full HD). [21] [22]

Displays capable of this resolution include an 82 inch LCD TV revealed by Samsung in early 2008, [23]  the Sony SRM-L560, a 56 inch LCD reference monitor announced in October 2009, [22]  an 84 inch display demonstrated by LG in mid-2010, [24]  and a 27.84 inch 158  PPI  4K IPS monitor for medical purposes launched by  Innolux  in November 2010. [25]  In October 2011  Toshiba  announced the REGZA 55x3, [26]  which is claimed to be the first 4K glasses-free 3D TV.

DisplayPort  supports 4K UHD at 30 Hz in version 1.1, and added support for 75 Hz in version 1.2 (2009) and 120 Hz in version 1.3 (2014), [27]  while  HDMI  added support for 4K UHD at 30 Hz in version 1.4 (2009) [28]  and 60 Hz in version 2.0 (2013). [29]

When support for 4K at 60 Hz was added in DisplayPort 1.2, no DisplayPort timing controllers (TCONs) existed which were capable of processing the necessary amount of data from a single video stream. As a result, the first 4K monitors from 2013 and early 2014, such as the SHARP PN-K321, ASUS PQ321Q, and Dell UP2414Q and UP3214Q, were addressed internally as two 1920×2160 monitors side-by-side instead of a single display and made use of DisplayPort's Multi-Stream Transport (MST) feature to multiplex a separate signal for each half over the connection, splitting the data between two timing controllers. [30] [31]  Newer timing controllers became available in 2014, and after mid-2014 new 4K monitors such as the  Asus  PB287Q no longer rely on MST tiling technique to achieve 4K at 60 Hz, [32]  instead using the standard SST (Single-Stream Transport) approach. [33]

In 2015 Sony announced the  Xperia Z5 Premium , the first smartphone with a 4K display. [34]

DCI 4K , also referred to as  Cinema 4K [35]  or  4K x 2K , was established by the  Digital Cinema Initiatives  consortium in 2005 and defines a resolution of 4096×2160 (8.8 megapixels) with an aspect ratio of ~19:10 for 4K film projection. [1]  This is the native resolution for DCI 4K digital projectors and displays.

HDMI added support for 4096×2160 at 30 Hz in version 1.4 [28]  and 60 Hz in version 2.0. [29] [36]

UW5K  ( Ultra-Wide 5K ), is a display resolution of 5120×2160 pixels in a 64:27 aspect ratio (≈21:9). The first monitor to support this resolution was the 105-inch LG 105UC9.

5K  is a display resolution of 5120×2880 with a 16:9  aspect ratio . Although it is not part of the UHDTV standard (or any other standard), [ citation needed ]  some manufacturers such as Dell have referred to it as  UHD+ . [37]  5K is exactly double the pixel count of WQHD (2560×1440) in each direction, for a total of four times as many pixels. The line count of 2880 is also the  least common multiple  of 480 and 576, the scanline count of NTSC and PAL, respectively. Such a resolution can vertically scale SD content to fit by  natural numbers  (6 for NTSC and 5 for PAL). Horizontal scaling of SD is always fractional (non-anamorphotic: 5.33...5.47, anamorphotic: 7.11...7.29).

The first display with this resolution was the Dell UltraSharp UP2715K, announced on September 5, 2014. [38]  On October 16, 2014, Apple announced the  iMac  with  Retina 5K display . [39] [40]

DisplayPort 1.3 added support for 5K at 60 Hz over a single cable, whereas DisplayPort 1.2 was only capable of 5K at 30 Hz. Early 5K 60 Hz displays such as the Dell UltraSharp UP2715K and HP DreamColor Z27q that lacked DisplayPort 1.3 support required two DisplayPort 1.2 connections to operate at 60 Hz, in a tiled display mode similar to early 4K displays using DP MST. [41]

UW8K  ( Ultra-Wide 8K ), is a display resolution of 7680×3200 pixels in a 12:5 aspect ratio (2.4:1, or 21.6:9).

8K UHD  ( Ultra HD ), also referred to as  UHDTV-2 , is a display resolution of 7680×4320 pixels (four times as many pixels as 4K UHD, or sixteen times as many pixels as Full HD) in the same 16:9  aspect ratio . [21]  This resolution is part of the UHDTV standard.

DisplayPort 1.3, finalized by VESA in late 2014, added support for this resolution at 30 Hz (or 60 Hz with YCbCr 4:2:0 subsampling). VESA's Display Stream Compression (DSC), which was part of early DisplayPort 1.3 drafts and would have enabled 8K at 60 Hz without subsampling, was cut from the specification prior to publication of the final draft. [42]

DSC support was reintroduced later on March 1, 2016 with the publication of DisplayPort 1.4. Using DSC, a "visually lossless" form of compression, resolutions of up to 7680×4320 (8K UHD) at 60 Hz with HDR and 30 bit/px color depth are possible without subsampling. [43]

Quarter-QVGA  ( QQVGA  or  qqVGA ) denotes a resolution of 160×120 or 120×160 pixels, usually used in displays of handheld devices. The term Quarter-QVGA signifies a resolution of one fourth the number of pixels in a  QVGA  display (half the number of vertical and half the number of horizontal pixels) which itself has one fourth the number of pixels in a  VGA  display.

The abbreviation  qqVGA  may be used to distinguish  quarter  from  quad , just like  qVGA . [44]

Half-QVGA  denotes a display screen resolution of 240×160 or 160×240 pixels, as seen on the  Game Boy Advance . This resolution is half of  QVGA , which is itself a quarter of  VGA , which is 640×480 pixels.

The  Quarter Video Graphics Array  (also known as  Quarter  VGA ,  QVGA , or  qVGA ) is a popular term for a computer display with 320×240  display resolution . QVGA displays were most often used in  mobile phones ,  personal digital assistants  (PDA), and some  handheld game consoles . Often the displays are in a " portrait " orientation (i.e., taller than they are wide, as opposed to " landscape ") and are referred to as 240×320. [45]

The name comes from having a  q uarter of the 640×480 maximum resolution of the original  IBM   VGA  display technology, which became a de facto industry standard in the late 1980s. QVGA is not a standard mode offered by the  VGA BIOS , even though VGA and compatible  chipsets  support a QVGA-sized  Mode X . The term refers only to the display's resolution and thus the abbreviated term QVGA or Quarter VGA is more appropriate to use.

QVGA resolution is also used in  digital video  recording equipment as a low-resolution mode requiring less data storage capacity than higher resolutions, typically in still  digital cameras  with video recording capability, and some  mobile phones . Each frame is an image of 320×240 pixels. QVGA video is typically recorded at 15 or 30  frames per second . QVGA mode describes the size of an image in pixels, commonly called the resolution; numerous  video file formats  support this resolution.

While QVGA is a  lower  resolution than VGA, at higher resolutions the "Q" prefix commonly means  quad(ruple)  or four times  higher  display resolution (e.g.,  QXGA  is four times higher resolution than  XGA ). To distinguish  quarter  from  quad , lowercase "q" is sometimes used for "quarter" and uppercase "Q" for "quad", by analogy with  SI prefixes  like m/M and p/P, but this is not a consistent usage. [46]

Some examples of devices that use QVGA display resolution include,  Samsung i5500 ,  LG Optimus L3 -E400,  Galaxy Fit ,  Y  and  Pocket ,  HTC Wildfire ,  Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 Mini  and  mini pro  and  Nintendo 3DS ' bottom screen.

Wide QVGA  or  WQVGA  is any  display resolution  having the same height in pixels as  QVGA , but wider. This definition is consistent with other 'wide' versions of computer displays.

Since QVGA is 320 pixels wide and 240 pixels high (aspect ratio of 4:3), the resolution of a WQVGA screen might be 360×240 (3:2 aspect ratio), 384×240 (16:10 aspect ratio), 400×240 (5:3 – such as the  Nintendo 3DS  screen or the maximum resolution in  YouTube  at 240p), 428×240 or 432×240 (~16:9 ratio). As with  WVGA , exact ratios of  n :9 are difficult because of the way VGA controllers internally deal with pixels. For instance, when using graphical combinatorial operations on pixels, VGA controllers will use 1 bit per pixel. Since bits cannot be accessed individually but by chunks of 16 or an even higher power of 2, this limits the horizontal resolution to a 16-pixel granularity, i.e., the horizontal resolution must be divisible by 16. In the case of 16:9 ratio, with 240 pixels high, the horizontal resolution should be 240 / 9 × 16 = 426. 6 , the closest multiple of 16 is 432.

WQVGA has also been used to describe displays that are not 240 pixels high, for example  Sixteenth HD1080  displays which are 480 pixels wide and 270 or 272 pixels high. This may be due to WQVGA having the nearest screen height.

WQVGA resolutions are commonly used in  touchscreen  mobile phones, such as 400×240, 432×240, and 480×240. For example, the Sony Ericsson Aino and the Samsung Instinct both have WQVGA screen resolutions – 240×432. Other devices such as the Apple  iPod Nano  also use a WQVGA screen, 240×376 pixels.

HVGA  ( Half-size  VGA ) screens have 480×320 pixels (3:2 aspect ratio), 480×360 pixels (4:3 aspect ratio), 480×272 (~16:9 aspect ratio) or 640×240 pixels (8:3 aspect ratio). The former is used by a variety of  PDA  devices, starting with the Sony  CLIÉ   PEG-NR70  in 2002, and standalone PDAs by  Palm . The latter was used by a variety of  handheld PC  devices. VGA resolution is 640×480.

Examples of devices that use HVGA include the Apple  iPhone  ( 1st generation  through  3GS ),  BlackBerry Bold  9000,  HTC Dream ,  Hero ,  Wildfire S ,  LG GW620  Eve,  MyTouch 3G Slide ,  Nokia 6260 Slide ,  Palm Pre ,  Samsung M900 Moment ,  Sony Ericsson Xperia X8 ,  mini ,  mini pro ,  active  and  live  and the  Sony PlayStation Portable .

Texas Instruments  produces the  DLP   pico projector  which supports HVGA resolution. [47]

HVGA was the only resolution supported in the first versions of Google  Android , up to release 1.5. [48]  Other higher and lower resolutions became available starting on release 1.6, like the popular  WVGA  resolution on the  Motorola Droid  or the  QVGA  resolution on the  HTC Tattoo .

Three-dimensional computer graphics  common on  television  throughout the 1980s were mostly rendered at this resolution, causing objects to have jagged edges on the top and bottom when edges were not anti-aliased.

Video Graphics Array  ( VGA ) refers specifically to the display hardware first introduced with the  IBM PS/2  line of computers in 1987. [49]  Through its widespread adoption, VGA has also come to mean either an  analog   computer display standard , the 15-pin  D-subminiature   VGA connector  or the  640×480  resolution itself. While the VGA resolution was superseded in the  personal computer  market in the 1990s, it became a popular resolution on mobile devices in the 2000s. [50]  VGA is still the universal fallback troubleshooting mode in the case of trouble with graphic device drivers in operating systems. In the field of videos the resolution of 640×480 is called  Standard Definition  ( SD ) - in comparison for instance to HD (1280×720) or Full HD (1920×1080).

Wide VGA  or  WVGA , sometimes just  WGA , an  abbreviation  for  Wide Video Graphics Array  is any  display resolution  with the same 480 pixel height as  VGA  but wider, such as 720×480 (3:2 aspect ratio), 800×480 (5:3), 848×480, 852×480, 853×480 or 854×480 (~16:9). It is a common resolution among  LCD projectors  and later portable and hand-held internet-enabled devices (such as  MID  and  Netbooks ) as it is capable of rendering web sites designed for an 800 wide window in full page-width. Examples of hand-held internet devices, without phone capability, with this resolution include:  Spice stellar nhance mi-435 ,  ASUS Eee PC  700 series,  Dell   XCD35 ,  Nokia   770 ,  N800 , and  N810 .

Mobile phones with WVGA display resolution are also common. A  list of mobile phones with WVGA display  is available.

FWVGA  is an  abbreviation  for  Full Wide Video Graphics Array  which refers to a display resolution of 854×480 pixels. 854×480 is approximately the 16:9  aspect ratio  of  anamorphically  "un-squeezed" NTSC DVD widescreen video and considered a "safe" resolution that does not crop any of the image. It is called  Full WVGA  to distinguish it from other, narrower WVGA resolutions which require cropping 16:9  aspect ratio   high-definition video  (i.e. it is full width, albeit with considerable  reduction in size ).

The 854 pixel width is rounded up from 853. 3 .  480 ×    16 ⁄ 9  =    7680 ⁄ 9  = 853   1 ⁄ 3 . Since a pixel must be a whole number, rounding up to 854 ensures inclusion of the entire image. [51]

In 2010,  mobile phones  with FWVGA display resolution started to become more common. A  list of mobile phones with FWVGA displays  is available. In addition, the  Wii U GamePad  that comes with the  Nintendo   Wii U  gaming console includes a 6.2 inch FWVGA display.

Super Video Graphics Array , abbreviated to  Super VGA  or  SVGA , also known as  Ultra Video Graphics Array , [52]  abbreviated to  Ultra VGA  or  UVGA , is a broad term that covers a wide range of  computer display standards . [53]

Originally, it was an extension to the  VGA  standard first released by  IBM  in 1987. Unlike VGA – a purely IBM-defined standard – Super VGA was defined by the  Video Electronics Standards Association  (VESA), an open consortium set up to promote interoperability and define standards. When used as a resolution specification, in contrast to  VGA  or  XGA  for example, the term  SVGA  normally refers to a resolution of 800×600 pixels.

The marginally higher resolution 832×624 is the highest 4:3 resolution not greater than 2 19  pixels, with its horizontal dimension a multiple of 32 pixels. This enables it to fit within a  framebuffer  of 512  KB  (512 × 2 10  bytes), and the common multiple of 32 pixels constraint is related to  alignment . For these reasons this resolution was available on the  Macintosh LC III  and other systems. [ citation needed ]

DVGA  ( Double-size  VGA ) screens have 960×640 pixels (3:2 aspect ratio). Both dimensions are double that of HVGA, hence the pixel count is quadrupled.

Examples of devices that use DVGA include the  Meizu MX  mobile phone and the Apple  iPhone  4/4S, where the screen is called the "Retina Display".

The wide version of SVGA is known as  WSVGA  ( Wide Super VGA ), featured on  Ultra-Mobile PCs ,  netbooks , and  tablet computers . The resolution is either 1024×576 (aspect ratio 16:9) or 1024×600 (between 15:9 and 16:9) with screen sizes normally ranging from 7 to 10 inches. It has full XGA width of 1024 pixels.

XGA , the  Extended Graphics Array , is an  IBM  display standard introduced in 1990. Later it became the most common appellation of the 1024×768 pixels  display resolution , but the official definition is broader than that. It was not a new and improved replacement for  Super VGA , but rather became one particular subset of the broad range of capabilities covered under the "Super VGA" umbrella.

The initial version of XGA (and its predecessor, the  IBM 8514 ) expanded upon IBM's older  VGA  by adding support for four new screen modes (three, for the 8514), including one new resolution: [54]

Like the 8514, XGA offered  fixed function   hardware acceleration  to offload processing of 2D drawing tasks. Both adaptors allowed offloading of line-draw, bitmap-copy ( bitblt ), and color-fill operations from the host  CPU . XGA's acceleration was faster than 8514's, and more comprehensive, supporting more drawing primitives, the VGA-res hi-color mode, versatile "brush" and "mask" modes, system memory addressing functions, and a single simple hardware sprite typically used to providing a low CPU load mouse pointer. It was also capable of wholly independent function, as it incorporated support for all existing VGA functions and modes – the 8514 itself was a simpler add-on adaptor that required a separate VGA to be present. It should be noted that, as they were designed for use with IBM's own range of fixed-frequency monitors, neither adaptor offered support for 800×600  SVGA  modes.

XGA-2  added a 24-bit  DAC , but this was used only to extend the available master palette in 256-color mode, e.g. to allow true 256-greyscale output instead of the 64 grey levels previously available; there was still no direct  Truecolor  mode despite the adaptor featuring enough default onboard VRAM (1 MB) to support it. Other improvements included provision of the previously missing 800×600 resolution (using an SVGA or multisync monitor) in up to 65,536 colors, faster screen refresh rates in all modes (including non-interlace, flicker-free output for 1024×768), and improved accelerator performance and versatility.

IBM licensed the XGA technology and architecture to certain third party hardware developers, and its characteristic modes (although not necessarily the accelerator functions, nor the MCA data-bus interface) were aped by many others. These accelerators typically did not suffer from the same limitations on available resolutions and refresh rate, and featured other now-standard modes like 800×600 (and 1280×1024) at various color depths (up to 24 bpp Truecolor) and interlaced, non-interlaced and flicker-free refresh rates even before the release of the XGA-2.

All standard XGA modes have a  4:3   aspect ratio  with square pixels, although this does not hold for certain standard VGA and third-party extended modes (640×400, 1280×1024).

XGA should not be confused with  EVGA  ( Extended Video Graphics Array ), a contemporaneous  VESA  standard that also has 1024×768 pixels. It should also not be confused with the  Expanded   Graphics Adapter , a peripheral for the  IBM 3270 PC  which can also be referred to as XGA. [56]

Wide Extended Graphics Array  ( Wide XGA  or  WXGA ) is a set of  non standard  resolutions derived from the  XGA   display standard  by widening it to a  wide screen   aspect ratio . WXGA is commonly used for low-end  LCD TVs  and LCD  computer monitors  for widescreen presentation. The exact resolution offered by a device described as "WXGA" can be somewhat variable owing to a proliferation of several closely related timings optimised for different uses and derived from different bases.

When referring to televisions and other monitors intended for consumer entertainment use, WXGA is generally understood to refer to a resolution of 1366×768, [57]  with an aspect ratio of very nearly 16:9. The basis for this otherwise odd seeming resolution is similar to that of other "wide" standards – the line scan (refresh) rate of the well-established "XGA" standard (1024×768 pixels, 4:3 aspect) extended to give square pixels on the increasingly popular 16:9 widescreen display ratio without having to effect major signalling changes other than a faster pixel clock, or manufacturing changes other than extending panel width by one third. As 768 does not divide exactly into 9, the aspect ratio is not  quite  16:9 – this would require a horizontal width of 1365.33 pixels. However, at only 0.05%, the resulting error is insignificant.

In 2006, 1366×768 was the most popular resolution for  liquid crystal display televisions  (versus XGA for  Plasma  TVs  flat panel displays ); [58]  by 2013, even this was relegated to only being used in smaller or cheaper displays (e.g. "bedroom" LCD TVs, or low-cost, large-format plasmas), cheaper laptop and mobile tablet computers, and midrange home cinema projectors, having otherwise been overtaken by higher "full HD" resolutions such as 1920×1080.

A common variant on this resolution is 1360×768, which confers several technical benefits, most significantly a reduction in memory requirements from just over to just under 1 MB per 8-bit channel (1366×768 needs 1024.5 KB per channel; 1360×768 needs 1020 KB; 1 MB is equal to 1024 KB), which simplifies architecture and can significantly reduce the amount – and speed – of VRAM required with only a very minor change in available resolution, as memory chips are usually only available in fixed megabyte capacities. For example, at 32-bit color, a 1360×768 framebuffer would require only 4 MB, whilst a 1366×768 one may need 5, 6 or even 8 MB depending on the exact display circuitry architecture and available chip capacities. The 6-pixel reduction also means each line's width is divisible by 8 pixels, simplifying numerous routines used in both computer and broadcast/theatrical video processing, which operate on 8-pixel blocks. Historically, many video cards also mandated screen widths divisible by 8 for their lower-color, planar modes to accelerate memory accesses and simplify pixel position calculations (e.g. fetching 4-bit pixels from 32-bit memory is much faster when performed 8 pixels at a time, and calculating exactly where a particular pixel is within a memory block is much easier when lines do not end partway through a memory word), and this convention still persisted in low-end hardware even into the early days of widescreen, LCD HDTVs; thus, most 1366-width displays also quietly support display of 1360-width material, with a thin border of unused pixel columns at each side. This narrower mode is of course even further removed from the 16:9 ideal, but the error is still less than 0.5% (technically, the mode is either 15.94:9.00 or 16.00:9.04) and should be imperceptible.

When referring to laptop displays or independent displays and projectors intended primarily for use with computers, WXGA is also used to describe a resolution of 1280×800 pixels, with an aspect ratio of  16:10 . [59] [60] [61]  This was once particularly popular for laptop screens, usually with a diagonal screen size of between 12 and 15 inches, as it provided a useful compromise between 4:3 XGA and 16:9 WXGA, with improved resolution in  both  dimensions vs. the old standard (especially useful in portrait mode, or for displaying two standard pages of text side-by-side), a perceptibly "wider" appearance and the ability to display 720p HD video "native" with only very thin letterbox borders (usable for on-screen playback controls) and no stretching. Additionally, like 1360×768, it required only 1000 KB (just under 1 MB) of memory per 8-bit channel; thus, a typical double-buffered 32-bit colour screen could fit within 8 MB, limiting everyday demands on the complexity (and cost, energy use) of integrated graphics chipsets and their shared use of typically sparse system memory (generally allocated to the video system in relatively large blocks), at least when only the internal display was in use (external monitors generally being supported in "extended desktop" mode to at least 1600×1200 resolution). 16:10 (or 8:5) is itself a rather "classic" computer aspect ratio, harking back all the way to early 320×200 modes (and their derivatives) as seen in the Commodore 64, IBM CGA card and others. However, as of mid 2013, this standard is becoming increasingly rare, crowded out by the more standardised and thus more economical-to-produce 1366×768 panels, as its previously beneficial features become less important with improvements to hardware, gradual loss of general backwards software compatibility, and changes in interface layout. As of August 2013, the market availability of panels with 1280×800 native resolution had been generally relegated to data projectors or niche products such as convertible tablet PCs and LCD-based eBook readers.

Additionally, two other resolutions are sometimes labelled as WXGA:

Recent widespread availability of 1280×800 and 1366×768 pixel resolution LCDs for laptop monitors can be considered an  OS -driven evolution from the formerly popular  1024×768  screen size, which has itself since seen UI design feedback in response to what could be considered disadvantages of the widescreen format when used with programs designed for "traditional" screens. In  Microsoft Windows   operating system  specifically, the larger  task bar  of Windows Vista and 7 occupies an additional 16 pixel lines by default, which may compromise the usability of programs that already demanded a full 1024×768 (instead of, e.g. 800×600) unless it is specifically set to use small icons; an "oddball" 784-line resolution would compensate for this, but 1280×800 has a simpler aspect and also gives the slight bonus of 16  more  usable lines. Also, the  Windows Sidebar  in  Windows Vista  and 7 can use the additional 256 or 336 horizontal pixels to display informational "widgets" without compromising the display width of other programs, and Windows 8 is specifically designed around a "two pane" concept where the full 16:9 or 16:10 screen is not required. Typically, this consists of a 4:3 main program area (typically 1024×768, 1000×800 or 1440×1080) plus a narrow sidebar running a second program, showing a toolbox for the main program or a pop-out OS shortcut panel taking up the remainder.

Some 1440×900 resolution displays have also been found labeled as WXGA; however, the correct label is actually  WSXGA or WXGA+ .

XGA+  stands for  Extended Graphics Array Plus  and is a  computer display standard , usually understood to refer to the 1152×864 resolution with an aspect ratio of 4:3. Until the advent of widescreen  LCDs , XGA+ was often used on 17-inch desktop  CRT  monitors. It is the highest 4:3 resolution not greater than 2 20  pixels (~1.05  megapixels ), with its horizontal dimension a multiple of 32 pixels. This enables it to fit closely into a video memory or framebuffer of 1  MB  (1 × 2 20   bytes ), assuming the use of one byte per pixel. The common multiple of 32 pixels constraint is related to  alignment .

Historically, the resolution also relates to the earlier standard of 1152×900 pixels, which was adopted by  Sun Microsystems  for the  Sun-2   workstation  in the early 1980s. A decade later,  Apple Computer  selected the resolution of 1152x870 for their 21-inch CRT monitors, intended for use as two-page displays on the  Macintosh II  computer. These resolutions are even closer to the limit of a 1 MB framebuffer, but their aspect ratios differ slightly from the common 4:3.

XGA+ is the next step after  XGA  (1024×768), although it is not approved by any standard organizations. The next step with an aspect ratio of 4:3 is 1280×960 (" SXGA- ") or  SXGA+  (1400×1050).

WXGA+  and  WSXGA  are non-standard terms referring to computer display resolutions. Usually they refer to a resolution of 1440×900, [ citation needed ]  but occasionally manufacturers use other terms to refer to this resolution. [63]  The Standard Panels Working Group refers to the 1440×900 resolution as WXGA(II). [64]

WSXGA and WXGA+ can be considered enhanced versions of  WXGA  with more pixels, or as widescreen variants of  SXGA . The aspect ratios of each are  16:10  ( widescreen ).

WXGA+ (1440×900) resolution is common in 19 in widescreen desktop monitors (a very small number of such monitors use  WSXGA+ ), and is also optional, although less common, in  laptop  LCDs, in sizes ranging from 12.1 in to 17 in. It is also used in the 13 inch  MacBook Air . [65]  With a 13.3 in screen this is 128 ppi.

The other one is 1440×960, which is 15:10 ( widescreen ).

SXGA  is an abbreviation for  Super Extended Graphics Array  referring to a standard  monitor  resolution of 1280×1024 pixels. This  display resolution  is the "next step" above the  XGA  resolution that  IBM  developed in 1990.

The 1280×1024 resolution is not the standard 4:3  aspect ratio , but 5:4 (1.25:1 instead of 1.333:1). A standard 4:3 monitor using this resolution will have rectangular rather than square pixels, meaning that unless the software compensates for this the picture will be distorted, causing circles to appear elliptical.

There is a less common 1280×960 resolution that preserves the common 4:3 aspect ratio. It is sometimes unofficially called  SXGA−  to avoid confusion with the "standard" SXGA. Elsewhere this 4:3 resolution was also called  UVGA  ( Ultra VGA ): Since both sides are doubled from VGA the term  Quad VGA  would be a systematic one, but it is hardly ever used, because its initialism  QVGA  is strongly associated with the alternate meaning  Quarter VGA  (320×240).

SXGA is the most common native resolution of 17 in and 19 in  LCD  monitors. An LCD monitor with SXGA native resolution will typically have a physical 5:4 aspect ratio, preserving a 1:1  pixel aspect ratio .

Sony  manufactured a 17 in  CRT  monitor with a 5:4 aspect ratio designed for this resolution. It was sold under the Apple brand name. [ citation needed ]

SXGA is also a popular resolution for cell phone cameras, such as the Motorola Razr and most Samsung and LG phones. Although being taken over by newer UXGA (2.0-megapixel) cameras, the 1.3-megapixel was the most common around 2007. [ citation needed ]

Any CRT that can run 1280×1024 can also run 1280×960, which has the standard 4:3 ratio. A flat panel  TFT  screen, including one designed for 1280×1024, will show stretching distortion when set to display any resolution other than its native one, as the image needs to be interpolated to fit in the fixed grid display. Some TFT displays do not allow a user to disable this, and will prevent the upper and lower portions of the screen from being used forcing a " letterbox " format when set to a 4:3 ratio. [ citation needed ]

The 1280×1024 resolution became popular because at  24-bit color  it fit well into 4  megabytes  of  video RAM . [ citation needed ]  At the time, memory was extremely expensive. Using 1280×1024 at 24-bit  color depth  allowed using 3.75  MB  of video RAM, fitting nicely with  VRAM  chip sizes which were available at the time (4 MB).

SXGA+  stands for  Super Extended Graphics Array Plus  and is a  computer display standard . An SXGA+ display is commonly used on 14-inch or 15-inch  laptop   LCD  screens with a  resolution  of 1400×1050 pixels. An SXGA+ display is used on a few 12-inch laptop screens such as the  ThinkPad  X60 and X61 (both only as tablet) as well as the  Toshiba  Portégé M200 and M400, but those are far less common. At 14.1 inches,  Dell  offered SXGA+ on many of the Dell Latitude "C" series laptops, such as the C640 and the C810, and Lenovo on the  ThinkPad  T61 and T61p.  Sony  also used SXGA+ in their Z1 series, but no longer produce them as  widescreen  has become more predominant.

There is a widescreen version of SXGA+ called  WSXGA+  with a resolution of 1680×1050. This is a common native resolution of 19–22-inch wide-aspect LCD monitors, and is also available on many laptops.

It is the next common step in resolution after  SXGA , although it is not approved by any organization. The most common resolution immediately above is called  UXGA  (sometimes also known as UGA), which has 1600×1200 pixels.

In desktop LCDs, SXGA+ is used on some low-end 20-inch monitors, whereas most of the 20-inch LCDs use UXGA (standard screen ratio), or WSXGA+ (widescreen ratio).

WSXGA+  stands for  Widescreen Super Extended Graphics Array Plus  and is a  computer display standard . A WSXGA+ display is commonly used on Widescreen 20 in, 21 in, and popular 22 in LCD monitors from numerous manufacturers (and a very small number of 19 in widescreen monitors), as well as widescreen 15.4 in and 17 in  laptop   LCD  screens like the  Thinkpad  T61 and the Apple 15 in  MacBook Pro . The  resolution  is 1680×1050 pixels (1,764,000 pixels) and has a  16:10   aspect ratio .

WSXGA+ is the widescreen version of  SXGA+ , but it is not approved by any organization. The next highest resolution (for widescreen) after it is  WUXGA , which is 1920×1200 pixels.

UXGA  or  UGA  is an abbreviation for  Ultra Extended Graphics Array  referring to a standard  monitor   resolution  of 1600×1200 pixels (totaling 1,920,000 pixels), which is exactly four times the default  resolution  of  SVGA  (800×600) (totaling 480,000 pixels).  Dell  Inc. refers to the same resolution of 1,920,000 pixels as  UGA . It is generally considered to be the next step above  SXGA  (1280×960 or 1280×1024), but some resolutions (such as the unnamed 1366×1024 and  SXGA+  at 1400×1050) fit between the two.

UXGA has been the native resolution of many fullscreen monitors of 15 in or more, including laptop LCDs such as the ones in  ThinkPad  A21p, A30p, A31p, T42p, T43p and T60p; Dell Inspiron 8000/8100/8200; Panasonic Toughbook CF-51; and the original Alienware Area 51m. However, in more recent times, UXGA is not used in laptops at all but rather in desktop UXGA monitors that have been made in sizes of 20 in and 21.3 in. Some 14 in laptop LCDs with UXGA have also existed, but these were very rare.

There are two different  widescreen  cousins of UXGA, one called UWXGA with 1600×768 (750) and one called  WUXGA  with 1920×1200 resolution.

WUXGA  stands for  Widescreen  Ultra Extended Graphics Array  and is a  display resolution  of 1920×1200 pixels (2,304,000 pixels) with a 16:10 screen  aspect ratio . It is a wide version of  UXGA , and can be used for viewing  high-definition television  (HDTV) content, which uses a 16:9 aspect ratio and a 1280×720 (720p) or 1920×1080 (1080i or 1080p) resolution.

The 16:10 aspect ratio (as opposed to the 16:9 used in widescreen televisions) was chosen because this aspect ratio is appropriate for displaying two full pages of text side by side. [66]

WUXGA resolution is 2.304 megapixels. An uncompressed 8-bit RGB WUXGA image has a size of ~6.6  MB  (6750 × 2 10  bytes). As of 2014, this resolution is available in a few high-end  LCD   televisions  and  computer monitors  (e.g. Dell Ultrasharp U2413, Lenovo L220x, Samsung T220P, ViewSonic SD-Z225, Asus PA248Q), although in the past it was used in a wider variety of displays, including 17 in laptops. WUXGA use predates the introduction of LCDs of that resolution. Most  QXGA  displays support 1920×1200 and widescreen  CRTs  such as the Sony GDM-FW900 and Hewlett Packard A7217A do as well. WUXGA is also available in some of the more high end mobile  phablet  devices such as the Huawei Honor X2 Gem.

The next lower resolution (for widescreen) before it is  WSXGA+ , which is 1680×1050 pixels (1,764,000 pixels, or 30.61% fewer than the WUXGA); the next higher resolution widescreen is an unnamed 2304×1440 resolution (supported by the above GDM-FW900 and A7217A) and then the more common  WQXGA , which has 2560×1600 pixels (4,096,000 pixels, or 77.78% more than WUXGA).

There are two wider formats called UWXGA 1600×768 (25:12) and  UW-UXGA  that has 2560×1080 pixels, a 2.37:1 or 21⅓:9 or 64:27 aspect ratio, sometimes erroneously labeled 21:9.

The  QXGA , or  Quad Extended Graphics Array , display standard is a resolution standard in display technology. Some examples of  LCD  monitors that have pixel counts at these levels are the Dell 3008WFP, the  Apple Cinema Display , the Apple  iMac  (27 inch 2009–present), the  iPad (3rd generation) , and the  MacBook Pro  (3rd generation). Many standard 21–22 in CRT monitors and some of the highest-end 19 in CRTs also support this resolution.

QWXGA  ( Quad Wide Extended Graphics Array ) is a  display resolution  of 2048×1152 pixels with a  16:9   aspect ratio . A few LCD QWXGA monitors were available in 2009 with 23- and 27-inch displays, such as the  Acer  B233HU (23-inch) and B273HU (27-inch), the  Dell  SP2309W, and the  Samsung  2343BWX. As of 2011, most 2048×1152 monitors have been discontinued, and as of 2013 no major manufacturer produces monitors with this resolution.

QXGA  ( Quad Extended Graphics Array ) is a  display resolution  of 2048×1536 pixels with a  4:3   aspect ratio . The name comes from it having four times as many pixels as an  XGA  display. Examples of LCDs with this resolution are the  IBM  T210 and the  Eizo  G33 and R31 screens, but in CRT monitors this resolution is much more common; some examples include the  Sony  F520,  ViewSonic  G225fB,  NEC  FP2141SB or  Mitsubishi  DP2070SB,  Iiyama  Vision Master Pro 514, and  Dell  and  HP  P1230. Of these monitors, none are still in production. A related display size is  WQXGA , which is a  wide screen  version. CRTs offer a way to achieve QXGA cheaply. Models like the Mitsubishi Diamond Pro 2045U and IBM ThinkVision C220P retailed for around 200 USD, and even higher performance ones like the ViewSonic PerfectFlat P220fB remained under 500 USD. At one time, many off-lease P1230s could be found on eBay for under 150 USD. The LCDs with WQXGA or QXGA resolution typically cost 4 to 5 times more for the same resolution.  IDTech  manufactured a 15 in QXGA  IPS  panel, used in some high-end IBM  ThinkPad  models. NEC sold laptops with QXGA screens in 2002–05 for the Japanese market. [67] [68]  The  iPad  (starting from 3rd generation) also has a QXGA display. [69]

Not to be confused with QWXGA.

WQXGA  ( Wide Quad Extended Graphics Array ) is a  display resolution  of 2560×1600 pixels with a  16:10   aspect ratio . The name comes from it being a wide version of QXGA and having four times as many pixels as an  WXGA  (1280×800) display.

To obtain a vertical refresh rate higher than 40 Hz, this resolution requires more bandwidth than a single link DVI supports and requires  dual-link  capable cables and devices. To avoid cable problems monitors are sometimes shipped with an appropriate dual link cable already plugged in. Many  video cards  support this resolution. One feature that is currently unique to the 30 inch WQXGA monitors is the ability to function as the centerpiece and main display of a three-monitor array of complementary aspect ratios, with two  UXGA  (1600×1200) 20 in monitors turned vertically on either side. The resolutions are equal, and the size of the 1600 resolution edges (if the manufacturer is honest) is within a tenth of an inch (16 in vs. 15.899 99 "), presenting a "picture window view" without the extreme lateral dimensions, small central panel, asymmetry, resolution differences, or dimensional difference of other three-monitor combinations. The resulting 4960×1600 composite image has a 3.1:1 aspect ratio. This also means one UXGA 20 in monitor in portrait orientation can also be flanked by two 30 inch WQXGA monitors for a 6320×1600 composite image with an 11.85:3 (79:20, 3.95:1) aspect ratio. Some WQXGA medical displays (such as the Barco Coronis 4MP) can also be configured as two virtual 1200×1600 or 1280×1600 seamless displays by using both DVI ports at the same time.

An early consumer WQXGA monitor was the 30 inch Apple Cinema Display, unveiled by Apple in June 2004. At the time, Dual-link DVI was uncommon on consumer hardware, so Apple partnered with Nvidia to develop a special graphics card that had two Dual-link DVI ports, allowing simultaneous use of two 30 inch Apple Cinema Displays. The nature of this graphics card, being an add-in AGP card, meant that the monitors could only be used in a desktop computer, like the Power Mac G5, that could have the add-in card installed, and could not be immediately used with laptop computers that lacked this expansion capability.

In 2010, WQXGA made its debut in a handful of home theater projectors targeted at the Constant Height Screen application market. Both Digital Projection Inc and projectiondesign released models based on a  Texas Instruments  DLP chip with a native WQXGA resolution, alleviating the need for an anamorphic lens to achieve 1:2.35 image projection. Many manufacturers have 27–30 inch models that are capable of WQXGA, albeit at a much higher price than lower resolution monitors of the same size. Several mainstream WQXGA monitors are or were available with 30-inch displays, such as the  Dell  3007WFP-HC, 3008WFP, U3011, U3014, UP3017, the  Hewlett-Packard  LP3065, the  Gateway  XHD3000,  LG  W3000H, and the  Samsung  305T. Specialist manufacturers like  NEC ,  Eizo ,  Planar Systems ,  Barco  (LC-3001), and possibly others offer similar models. As of 2016,  LG Display  make a 10-bit 30 inch AH-IPS panel, with wide color gamut, used in monitors from Dell, NEC, HP, Lenovo and Iiyama.

Released in November 2012, Google's  Nexus 10  is the first consumer  tablet  to feature WQXGA resolution. Before its release, the highest resolution available on a tablet was QXGA (2048×1536), available on the Apple  iPad  3rd and 4th generations devices. Several Samsung Galaxy tablets, including the Note 10.1 (2014 Edition), Tab S 8.4, 10.5 and TabPRO 8.4, 10.1 and Note Pro 12.2, as well as the Gigaset QV1030, also feature a WQXGA resolution display.

In 2012 Apple released the 13 inch MacBook Pro with Retina Display that features a WQXGA display.

QSXGA  ( Quad Super Extended Graphics Array ) is a display resolution of 2560×2048 pixels with a 5:4  aspect ratio . Grayscale monitors with a 2560×2048 resolution, primarily for medical use, are available from  Planar Systems  (Dome E5),  Eizo  (Radiforce G51),  Barco  (Nio 5, MP),  WIDE  (IF2105MP),  IDTech  (IAQS80F), and possibly others.

Recent medical displays such as Barco Coronis Fusion 10MP or NDS Dome S10 have native panel resolution of 4096×2560. These are driven by two dual-link DVI or  DisplayPort  outputs. They can be considered to be two seamless virtual QSXGA displays as they have to be driven simultaneously by both dual link DVI or DisplayPort since one dual link DVI or DisplayPort cannot single-handedly display 10 megapixels. A similar resolution of 2560×1920 (4:3) was supported by a small number of CRT displays via VGA such as the Viewsonic P225f when paired with the right graphics card.

WQSXGA  ( Wide Quad Super Extended Graphics Array ) describes a display standard that can support a resolution up to 3200×2048 pixels, assuming a 1.56:1 (25:16) aspect ratio. The Coronis Fusion 6MP DL by  Barco  supports 3280×2048 (approximately 16:10).

QUXGA  ( Quad Ultra Extended Graphics Array ) describes a display standard that can support a resolution up to 3200×2400 pixels, assuming a 4:3 aspect ratio.

WQUXGA  ( Wide Quad Ultra Extended Graphics Array ) describes a display standard that supports a resolution of 3840×2400 pixels, which provides a 16:10 aspect ratio. This resolution is exactly four times 1920×1200 (in pixels).

WQUXGA is the maximum resolution supported by  DisplayPort  1.2, though actually displaying such a resolution on a device with DisplayPort 1.2 is dependent on the graphics system in much the same way devices with VGA connectors do not necessarily maximize that standard's highest possible resolution. Most  display cards  with a DVI connector are capable of supporting the 3840×2400 resolution. However, the maximum refresh rate will be limited by the number of DVI links which are connected to the monitor. 1, 2, or 4 DVI connectors are used to drive the monitor using various tile configurations. Only the IBM T221-DG5 and IDTech MD22292B5 support the use of dual-link DVI ports through an external converter box. Many systems using these monitors use at least two DVI connectors to send video to the monitor. These DVI connectors can be from the same graphics card, different graphics cards, or even different computers. Motion across the tile boundary(ies) can show  tearing  if the DVI links are not synchronized. The display panel can be updated at a speed between 0 Hz and 41 Hz (48 Hz for the IBM T221-DG5, -DGP, and IDTech MD22292B5). The refresh rate of the video signal can be higher than 41 Hz (or 48 Hz) but the monitor will not update the display any faster even if graphics card(s) do so.

In June 2001, WQUXGA was introduced in the  IBM T220  LCD  monitor  using a LCD panel built by  IDTech . LCD displays that support WQUXGA resolution include:  IBM T220 ,  IBM T221 ,  Iiyama  AQU5611DTBK,  ViewSonic   VP2290 , [70]  ADTX MD22292B, and  IDTech  MD22292 (models B0, B1, B2, B5, C0, C2). IDTech was the original equipment manufacturer which sold these monitors to ADTX,  IBM ,  Iiyama , and  ViewSonic . [71]  However, none of the WQUXGA monitors (IBM, ViewSonic, Iiyama, ADTX) are in production anymore: they had prices that were well above even the higher end displays used by graphic professionals, and the lower refresh rates, 41 Hz and 48 Hz, made them less attractive for many applications.

The  HXGA  display standard and its derivatives are a standard in display technology.

HXGA , an abbreviation for  H exadecatuple E x tended  G raphics  A rray is a display standard that can support a resolution of 4096×3072 pixels (or 3200 pixels) with a 4:3 aspect ratio. The name comes from it having sixteen ( hexadecatuple ) times as many pixels as an  XGA  display.

WHXGA  an abbreviation for  W ide  H exadecatuple E x tended  G raphics  A rray is a display standard that can support a resolution of roughly 5120×3200 pixels with a 16:10 aspect ratio. The name comes from it being a wide version of HXGA, which has sixteen ( hexadecatuple ) times as many pixels as an  XGA  display.

HSXGA , an abbreviation for  H exadecatuple  S uper E x tended  G raphics  A rray, is a display standard that can support a resolution of roughly 5120×4096 pixels with a 5:4 aspect ratio. The name comes from it having sixteen ( hexadecatuple ) times as many pixels as an  SXGA  display.

WHSXGA , an abbreviation for  W ide  H exadecatuple  S uper E x tended  G raphics  A rray, is a display standard that can support a resolution up to 6400×4096 pixels, assuming a 1.56:1 (25:16) aspect ratio. The name comes from it having sixteen ( hexadecatuple ) times as many pixels as an  WSXGA  display.

HUXGA , an abbreviation for  H exadecatuple  U ltra E x tended  G raphics  A rray, is a display standard that can support a resolution of roughly 6400×4800 pixels with a 4:3 aspect ratio. The name comes from it having sixteen ( hexadecatuple ) times as many pixels as an  UXGA  display.

WHUXGA , an abbreviation for  W ide  H exadecatuple  U ltra E x tended  G raphics  A rray, is a display standard that can support a resolution up to 7680×4800 pixels, assuming a 16:10 (8:5) aspect ratio. The name comes from it having sixteen ( hexadecatuple ) times as many pixels as a  WUXGA  display.
