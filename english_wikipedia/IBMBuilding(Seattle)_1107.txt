The  IBM Building  is a 20-story  skyscraper  in the  Metropolitan Tract  at 1200 Fifth Avenue,  Seattle ,  Washington . [4]  The building was designed by  Minoru Yamasaki , who also was architect of  Rainier Tower  on the corner diagonally opposite, and the  World Trade Center  in  New York City . Its construction was completed in 1963. [5]

Nard Jones  wrote in 1972 that "There is an architectural poetry about [the building] that is at variance with the endless jibes at computerization and the alleged sober pragmatism of IBM personnel. [6]

The corner of the complex at 5th Street and University Avenue was once the site of the  Seattle Ice Arena  from 1915 to 1963.
