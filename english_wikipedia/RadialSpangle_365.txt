Radial Spangle  was an  indie rock  band from  Norman, Oklahoma ,  United States , that released two albums in the 1990s.

The band was formed in 1991 by Alan Laird ( vocals ,  guitar ), April Tippens ( bass guitar ), and former  Flaming Lips  drummer Richard English. [1] [2]  The band members were friends of  Mercury Rev , whose David Fridmann engineered their debut album,  Ice Cream Headache , released in 1993 on the Mint Tea label. [1]  The album featured boy/girl vocal harmonies and an array of guitar effects. Shortly after the album was released, English was replaced by Kelsey Kennedy. [2]  After a further single, "Raze", on Mint Tea, the band signed to  Beggars Banquet Records , who issued the "Birthday"  EP  (which included the three tracks recorded for a session for  John Peel 's  BBC Radio 1  show in July) in late 1993, and the band's second album,  Syrup Macrame , again with Fridmann at the controls, in August 1994. [1] [2]  The band split up in 1996.

Laird later released Radial Spangle songs under the name  The Charm Pops , with recordings that included Tippens and Kennedy and later a variety of musician friends to complete the album.
