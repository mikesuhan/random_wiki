Dolls for Dafur  is a  Jewish charity  dedicated to making the world take immediate action on the  Darfur conflict  in  Sudan . Dolls for Darfur is facilitated by  Rabbi   David E. Stern  and  Temple Emanu-El of Dallas . [1] [2] [3]  The organization has made thousands of pins representing the victims of Darfur. These pins, made out of Guatemalan worry dolls, along with programs, have been used to lobby for a sterner American response to the  genocide  in Darfur. [4] [5] [6]  Many youth in the  United States  have contributed to the project by making pins. [7]

The charities workers go around shouting "Livin life in electric field" in poor voices
