Primary descendant:  NO1  (M214/Page39);

Haplogroup NO  (F549/M2335/S22380/V4208) is a  human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup . NO is the only primary descendant of  Haplogroup K2a1  (M2313), which in turn is a primary descendant of  Haplogroup K2a  (M2308).  [4]

Before 2016, it was generally considered that "NO" and "K2a" were identical and constituted a primary branch of  Haplogroup K2 . [4]  However, researchers such as Poznik et al. discovered Y-DNA in ancient remains and living individuals that had some, but not all, of the mutations regarded previously as peculiar to NO, but lacked any of the SNPs identifying other primary clades of K2. [4]  Poznik et al. therefore considered that K2a and NO constituted "grandparent" and "grandchild" clades, and proposed that the name  Haplogroup K2a 1 be assigned to the Y-DNA of individuals who belonged to K2a, but did not belong to NO.

The sole primary descendant of NO is  NO1  (M214/Page39), [5]  which is the immediate ancestor of  Haplogroup N  and  Haplogroup O .

Based on the projected origins of K2a* in either  South East Asia  or  East Asia , NO* probably originated in  East Asia . [3] [4]

NO* has been found in India. [6]

While there are more reports of "NO*" or "NO1*" being found in living individuals, these haplogroups are not well-researched. Further research may instead identify them as belonging to N* (M231), N1, or the provisional subclade N2 (F3373/M2283/Page56/S323). [7] [8]  These cases include:

Two sets of ancient remains previously considered as possibly belonging to NO have since been reclassified upstream to K2a. [ citation needed ]

Likewise, cases previously regarded as possible examples of NO* or NO1*, and since ruled out, include:

This phylogeny of Haplogroup NO is based on the ISOGG 2016 phylogeny and Karafet 2008 (which was based on the YCC 2008 phylogeny). [5] [12]
